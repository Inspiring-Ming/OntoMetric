It lacks both quantitative measurement specifications and qualitative disclosure process requirements that would characterize an ESG metric.
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_9_012,Metric,Expenditure Impact from Climate Risks,"This describes a conceptual relationship between cost structure and climate resilience, but does not specify an actual metric to be disclosed (no quantitative measure with units or specific qualitative disclosure requirement). It reads as explanatory context rather than a measurable or reportable metric."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_9_013,Metric,Assets and Liabilities Impact,"This describes a general risk category or impact area related to climate change effects on asset valuation, but does not represent an actual ESG metric (quantitative measure with units) or specific disclosure requirement (defined process or governance structure to be reported)."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_9_014,Metric,Capital and Financing Impact,This describes a conceptual relationship or potential impact category rather than an actual metric. It lacks both quantitative measurement specifications (no units or values) and specific disclosure requirements that would make it actionable as an ESG metric.
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_14_009,Metric,Metrics for Assessing Climate-related Risks and Opportunities,"This entity describes a disclosure requirement about metrics rather than being an actual metric itself. A proper Metric entity should contain the specific measurement or qualitative disclosure (e.g., 'Scope 1 GHG emissions in tonnes CO2e' or 'Climate risk governance process'), not a requirement to disclose metrics."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_14_011,Metric,Targets for Managing Climate-related Risks and Performance,"This entity describes a disclosure requirement about targets rather than being a metric itself. A metric would be the actual target values or performance measurements (e.g., '50% emissions reduction by 2030'), not the requirement to describe targets."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_18_001,Metric,Disclosure Relevance,"This describes a qualitative principle or criterion for evaluating disclosures rather than an actual ESG metric or disclosure requirement. It is a meta-level statement about what disclosures should be, not a specific quantitative metric or qualitative disclosure requirement itself."

It is a meta-level guideline about how disclosures should be made, not a specific ESG metric or disclosure requirement."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_18_003,Metric,Disclosure Clarity and Understandability,"This represents a qualitative principle or requirement about how disclosures should be presented, but it does not itself constitute a metric. A metric would need to specify what is being measured or disclosed (e.g., 'Assessment of disclosure clarity' with criteria), not just state that disclosures should have certain characteristics."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_18_004,Metric,Disclosure Consistency Over Time,"This describes a principle or requirement about how disclosures should be made (consistency over time), rather than an actual metric or disclosure requirement itself. It is a meta-level guideline about disclosure quality, not a specific ESG metric with quantitative measures or qualitative disclosure requirements."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_18_005,Metric,Disclosure Comparability,"This describes a qualitative characteristic or principle that disclosures should possess (comparability), rather than an actual metric or disclosure requirement itself.

It is a meta-level guideline about disclosure timing, not an actual ESG metric or disclosure content itself."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_20_003,Metric,"Impact on Businesses, Strategy, and Financial Planning","This entity describes a qualitative disclosure requirement about strategic impacts, but it is framed as a broad reporting requirement rather than a specific metric or disclosure item. It lacks the specificity of either a measurable metric with units or a defined qualitative disclosure element that would be reported."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_23_001,Metric,Base Year for Progress Measurement,"A base year is a reference point or parameter used in calculations, not a metric itself. It does not represent a quantitative measurement with units or a qualitative disclosure requirement, but rather serves as a temporal anchor for measuring progress."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_28_004,Metric,Regional and Market Parameter Differences,"This describes assumptions about parameter variations across geographic areas, which is a methodological consideration or analytical approach rather than an actual ESG metric or disclosure requirement. It does not represent a quantitative measurement with units or a specific qualitative disclosure requirement."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_28_005,Metric,Sensitivities to Key Assumptions,"This entity describes a sensitivity analysis or methodology rather than an actual ESG metric. It lacks both the quantitative measurement aspect (no specific values or units) and does not represent a concrete disclosure requirement, but rather refers to analytical assumptions."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_28_008,Metric,Strategic Performance Implications,This entity describes a qualitative analytical concept (implications under scenarios) rather than a measurable metric or specific disclosure requirement. It lacks both quantitative measurement characteristics and the specificity of a defined disclosure requirement that the Metric type demands.
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_28_009,Metric,Value Chain Implications,"This entity describes potential implications rather than an actual ESG disclosure metric. A valid Metric should represent either a quantitative measurement with units or a specific qualitative disclosure requirement, not general implications or consequences."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_28_010,Metric,Capital Allocation Decisions,"This describes a business process or decision-making activity, not a measurable metric or disclosure requirement. A metric would need to specify what is being measured about capital allocation decisions (e.g., 'percentage of capital allocated based on climate scenarios' or 'disclosure of capital allocation methodology')."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_28_011,Metric,Research and Development Focus,"This entity describes a general area of focus or consideration rather than a specific quantitative metric with units or a defined qualitative disclosure requirement. It lacks the specificity needed to be an ESG metric - it doesn't indicate what is being measured, reported, or disclosed about R&D focus."
TCFD Report,metric_TCFD_28_012,Metric,Material Financial Implications,"This entity describes a conceptual category or topic area (financial implications) rather than an actual metric with measurable values or specific disclosure requirements. A proper metric would specify what is being measured, reported, or disclosed (e.g., 'quantified financial impact from climate risks' or 'narrative description of material financial implications')."
TCFD Report,industry_TCFD-Generic,Industry,Organizations (Financial and Non-Financial),"The extracted entity 'Organizations (Financial and Non-Financial)' represents a broad categorization of organizational types rather than a specific business sector or industry classification. It is too generic and does not identify a particular industry like the examples provided (Commercial Banks, Oil & Gas, etc.)."
TCFD Report,category_TCFD_39,Category,Key Issues Considered and Areas for Further Work: Organizational Ownership,This appears to be a section heading or discussion topic rather than a thematic grouping of ESG disclosures. It describes a specific issue under consideration ('Organizational Ownership') rather than representing a broad categorical framework for organizing ESG information like 'Governance' or 'Risk Management' would.

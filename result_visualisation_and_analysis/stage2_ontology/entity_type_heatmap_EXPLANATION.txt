ENTITY TYPE HEATMAP (ONTOLOGY-GUIDED)
================================================================================

FIGURE DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This heatmap visualizes the distribution of entity types across all documents.
- Rows represent documents
- Columns represent entity types
- Color intensity indicates count (darker = more entities of that type)
- Numbers in cells show exact entity counts

DATA SOURCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entity data from Stage 2 ontology-guided extraction:
  • outputs/stage2_ontology_guided_extraction/*_ontology_guided.json

ENTITY TYPES ANALYZED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total entity types found: 5

Category:
  • Total count: 44
  • Percentage: 12.1%
  • Present in 5 documents

Industry:
  • Total count: 20
  • Percentage: 5.5%
  • Present in 5 documents

Metric:
  • Total count: 266
  • Percentage: 73.1%
  • Present in 5 documents

Model:
  • Total count: 29
  • Percentage: 8.0%
  • Present in 5 documents

ReportingFramework:
  • Total count: 5
  • Percentage: 1.4%
  • Present in 5 documents

KEY INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Helps identify which entity types are most common across documents
• Shows document-specific patterns (which docs focus on which types)
• Reveals ontology schema coverage and balance
• Can identify missing or underrepresented entity types

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Empty cells (count = 0) = That entity type was not found in that document
• Darker cells = Higher concentration of that entity type
• Rows with many dark cells = Documents with diverse entity types
• Columns with many dark cells = Entity types common across documents

STAGE 2: EXTRACTION COMPARISON
================================================================================

FIGURE DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This figure compares the extraction volumes between ontology-guided and
baseline methods in Stage 2 (extraction phase).

LEFT PANEL: Entities Extracted
  - Shows the number of entities extracted per document by each method
  - Blue bars: Baseline method (permissive extraction)
  - Purple bars: Ontology-Guided method (constrained extraction)

RIGHT PANEL: Relationships Extracted
  - Shows the number of relationships extracted per document
  - Same color scheme as entities panel


SUMMARY STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entities Extracted:
  Ontology-Guided Total:     364 entities
  Baseline Total:            729 entities
  Ontology-Guided Average:   72.8 entities per document
  Baseline Average:         145.8 entities per document
  Baseline/Ontology Ratio:   2.00x

Relationships Extracted:
  Ontology-Guided Total:     350 relationships
  Baseline Total:            940 relationships
  Ontology-Guided Average:   70.0 relationships per document
  Baseline Average:         188.0 relationships per document
  Baseline/Ontology Ratio:   2.69x


KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. VOLUME DIFFERENCE:
   - Baseline extracts ~2.0x more entities than ontology-guided
   - Baseline extracts ~2.7x more relationships than ontology-guided

2. METHOD CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Baseline: Permissive extraction, accepts more varied entity/relationship types
   - Ontology-Guided: Constrained extraction, only accepts ontology-defined types

3. IMPLICATIONS:
   - Higher volume in baseline does NOT mean higher quality
   - Stage 3 validation will filter out invalid entities/relationships
   - Ontology-guided pre-filtering reduces downstream validation burden


INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The baseline method's higher extraction volume reflects its permissive approach,
which accepts any entity or relationship type without ontology constraints.
However, many of these extracted elements will fail validation in Stage 3 because
they violate ontological rules (e.g., invalid entity types, missing required
properties, incompatible relationship endpoints).

The ontology-guided method's lower volume reflects its pre-filtering approach,
which only extracts entities and relationships that conform to the ontology schema.
This reduces computational cost and improves data quality by preventing invalid
extractions from entering the pipeline.

The true measure of quality comes in Stage 3, where validation quality scores
reveal which method produces more valid, usable knowledge graph elements.

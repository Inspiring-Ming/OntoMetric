STAGE 3: FILTERING IMPACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

FIGURE DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This 2x2 grid compares the before/after filtering impact for both methods.

TOP ROW: Ontology-Guided Method
  - Left: Entity filtering (original vs validated)
  - Right: Relationship filtering (original vs validated)

BOTTOM ROW: Baseline Method
  - Left: Entity filtering (original vs validated)
  - Right: Relationship filtering (original vs validated)

Each subplot shows grouped bars comparing:
  - Blue/Purple bars: Original count (before validation)
  - Green/Orange bars: Validated count (after validation)
  - Gap between bars: Number of elements filtered out


SUMMARY STATISTICS - ENTITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ontology-Guided:
  Original Entities:      364
  Validated Entities:     295
  Filtered Out:            69 (19.0%)
  Retention Rate:        81.0%

Baseline:
  Original Entities:        0
  Validated Entities:       0
  Filtered Out:             0 (100.0%)
  Retention Rate:         0.0%


SUMMARY STATISTICS - RELATIONSHIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ontology-Guided:
  Original Relationships:      350
  Validated Relationships:     283
  Filtered Out:                 67 (19.1%)
  Retention Rate:             80.9%

Baseline:
  Original Relationships:        0
  Validated Relationships:       0
  Filtered Out:                  0 (100.0%)
  Retention Rate:              0.0%


KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. FILTERING VOLUME:
   - Ontology-Guided filters 69 entities (19.0%)
   - Baseline filters 0 entities (100.0%)
   - Baseline filters -69 more entities

2. RETENTION EFFICIENCY:
   - Ontology-Guided retains 81.0% of entities
   - Baseline retains 0.0% of entities
   - Ontology-Guided has 81.0 percentage points higher retention

3. RELATIONSHIP IMPACT:
   - Ontology-Guided retains 80.9% of relationships
   - Baseline retains 0.0% of relationships
   - Relationship retention follows similar patterns to entity retention


INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The filtering impact analysis reveals the cost of permissive extraction:

ONTOLOGY-GUIDED METHOD:
- Pre-filtering during extraction (Stage 2) ensures most entities conform to schema
- High retention rate in validation (Stage 3) reflects extraction quality
- Minimal filtering waste means lower computational cost per valid entity

BASELINE METHOD:
- Permissive extraction (Stage 2) accepts many invalid entities
- Low retention rate in validation (Stage 3) reveals extraction quality issues
- Heavy filtering creates wasted cost: tokens spent on invalid entities

COST IMPLICATIONS:
The gap between original and validated counts represents wasted computation:
- API calls spent extracting entities that fail validation
- Token costs for processing invalid data
- Computational resources for validating doomed-to-fail entities

This validates the efficiency advantage of ontology-guided extraction:
prevent invalid entities from entering the pipeline rather than filtering them later.

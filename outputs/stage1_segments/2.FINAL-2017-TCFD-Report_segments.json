Bloomberg\nMr. Mark Carney\nChairman\nFinancial Stability Board\nBank for International Settlements\nCentralbahnplatz 2\nCH-4002 Basel\nSwitzerland\nDear Chairman Carney,\nOn behalf of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, I am pleased to present this final report\nsetting out our recommendations for helping businesses disclose climate-related financial information.\nAs you know, warming of the planet caused by greenhouse gas emissions poses serious risks to the global\neconomy and will have an impact across many economic sectors. It is difficult for investors to know which\ncompanies are most at risk from climate change, which are best prepared, and which are taking action.\nThe Task Force’s report establishes recommendations for disclosing clear, comparable and consistent\ninformation about the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. Their widespread adoption will\nensure that the effects of climate change become routinely considered in business and investment decisions.\nAdoption of these recommendations will also help companies better demonstrate responsibility and foresight\nin their consideration of climate issues. That will lead to smarter, more efficient allocation of capital, and help\nsmooth the transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon economy.\nThe industry Task Force spent 18 months consulting with a wide range of business and financial leaders to\nhone its recommendations and consider how to help companies better communicate key climate-related\ninformation. The feedback we received in response to the Task Force’s draft report confirmed broad support\nfrom industry and others, and involved productive dialogue among companies and banks, insurers, and\ninvestors. This was and remains a collaborative process, and as these recommendations are implemented, we\nhope that this dialogue and feedback continues.\nSince the Task Force began its work, we have also seen a significant increase in demand from investors for\nimproved climate-related financial disclosures. This comes amid unprecedented support among companies for\naction to tackle climate change.\nI want to thank the Financial Stability Board for its leadership in promoting better disclosure of climate-related\nfinancial risks, and for its support of the Task Force’s work. I am also grateful to the Task Force members and\nSecretariat for their extensive contributions and dedication to this effort.\nThe risk climate change poses to businesses and financial markets is real and already present. It is more\nimportant than ever that businesses lead in understanding and responding to these risks—and seizing the\nopportunities—to build a stronger, more resilient, and sustainable global economy.\nSincerely,\nMichael R. Bloombergr from Michael R. Bloomberg\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures i",

    "content": "Executive Summary\nFinancial Markets and Transparency\nOne of the essential functions of financial markets is to price risk to support informed, efficient\ncapital-allocation decisions. Accurate and timely disclosure of current and past operating and\nfinancial results is fundamental to this function, but it is increasingly important to understand the\ngovernance and risk management context in which financial results are achieved. The financial\ncrisis of 2007-2008 was an important reminder of the repercussions that weak corporate\ngovernance and risk management practices can have on asset values. This has resulted in\nincreased demand for transparency from organizations on their governance structures,\nstrategies, and risk management practices. Without the right information, investors and others\nmay incorrectly price or value assets, leading to a misallocation of capital.\nIncreasing transparency makes markets more efficient and\neconomies more stable and resilient.\n—Michael R. Bloomberg\nFinancial Implications of Climate Change\nOne of the most significant, and perhaps most misunderstood, risks that organizations face today\nrelates to climate change. While it is widely recognized that continued emission of greenhouse\ngases will cause further warming of the planet and this warming could lead to damaging\neconomic and social consequences, the exact timing and severity of physical effects are difficult to\nestimate. The large-scale and long-term nature of the problem makes it uniquely challenging,\nespecially in the context of economic decision making. Accordingly, many organizations\nincorrectly perceive the implications of climate change to be long term and, therefore, not\nnecessarily relevant to decisions made today.\nThe potential impacts of climate change on organizations, however, are not only physical and do\nnot manifest only in the long term. To stem the disastrous effects of climate change within this\ncentury, nearly 200 countries agreed in December 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and\naccelerate the transition to a lower-carbon economy. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\nimplies movement away from fossil fuel energy and related physical assets. This coupled with\nrapidly declining costs and increased deployment of clean and energy-efficient technologies could\nhave significant, near-term financial implications for organizations dependent on extracting,\nproducing, and using coal, oil, and natural gas. While such organizations may face significant\nclimate-related risks, they are not alone. In fact, climate-related risks and the expected transition\nto a lower-carbon economy affect most economic sectors and industries. While changes\nassociated with a transition to a lower-carbon economy present significant risk, they also create\nsignificant opportunities for organizations focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation\nsolutions.\nFor many investors, climate change poses significant financial challenges and opportunities, now\nand in the future. The expected transition to a lower-carbon economy is estimated to require\naround $1 trillion of investments a year for the foreseeable future, generating new investment\nopportunities.1 At the same time, the risk-return profile of organizations exposed to climate-\nrelated risks may change significantly as such organizations may be more affected by physical\nimpacts of climate change, climate policy, and new technologies. In fact, a 2015 study estimated\nthe value at risk, as a result of climate change, to the total global stock of manageable assets as\n1 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook Special Briefing for COP21, 2015.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ii\n\nranging from $4.2 trillion to $43 trillion between now and the end of the century.2 The study\nhighlights that “much of the impact on future assets will come through weaker growth and lower\nasset returns across the board.” This suggests investors may not be able to avoid climate-related\nrisks by moving out of certain asset classes as a wide range of asset types could be affected. Both\ninvestors and the organizations in which they invest, therefore, should consider their longer-term\nstrategies and most efficient allocation of capital. Organizations that invest in activities that may\nnot be viable in the longer term may be less resilient to the transition to a lower-carbon economy;\nand their investors will likely experience lower returns. Compounding the effect on longer-term\nreturns is the risk that present valuations do not adequately factor in climate-related risks\nbecause of insufficient information. As such, long-term investors need adequate information on\nhow organizations are preparing for a lower-carbon economy.\nFurthermore, because the transition to a lower-carbon economy requires significant and, in some\ncases, disruptive changes across economic sectors and industries in the near term, financial\npolicymakers are interested in the implications for the global financial system, especially in terms\nof avoiding financial dislocations and sudden losses in asset values. Given such concerns and the\npotential impact on financial intermediaries and investors, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central\nBank Governors asked the Financial Stability Board to review how the financial sector can take\naccount of climate-related issues. As part of its review, the Financial Stability Board identified the\nneed for better information to support informed investment, lending, and insurance underwriting\ndecisions and improve understanding and analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities.\nBetter information will also help investors engage with companies on the resilience of their\nstrategies and capital spending, which should help promote a smooth rather than an abrupt\ntransition to a lower-carbon economy.\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\nTo help identify the information needed by investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters to\nappropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities, the Financial Stability\nBoard established an industry-led task force: the Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (Task Force). The Task Force was asked to develop voluntary, consistent climate-\nrelated financial disclosures that would be useful to investors, lenders, and insurance\nunderwriters in understanding material risks. The 32-member Task Force is global; its members\nwere selected by the Financial Stability Board and come from various organizations, including\nlarge banks, insurance companies, asset managers, pension funds, large non-financial companies,\naccounting and consulting firms, and credit rating agencies. In its work, the Task Force drew on\nmember expertise, stakeholder engagement, and existing climate-related disclosure regimes to\ndevelop a singular, accessible framework for climate-related financial disclosure.\nThe Task Force developed four widely\nFigure 1\nadoptable recommendations on climate-\nKey Features of Recommendations\nrelated financial disclosures that are\napplicable to organizations across sectors  Adopta b le by all organizations\nand jurisdictions (Figure 1).

Bank assets were excluded as they are largely managed by banks themselves.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures iii\n\nimportant role to play in influencing the organizations in which they invest to provide better\nclimate-related financial disclosures.\nIn developing and finalizing its recommendations, the Task Force solicited input throughout the\nprocess.3 First, in April 2016, the Task Force sought public comment on the scope and high-level\nobjectives of its work. As the Task Force developed its disclosure recommendations, it continued\nto solicit feedback through hundreds of industry interviews, meetings, and other touchpoints.\nThen, in December 2016, the Task Force issued its draft recommendations and sought public\ncomment on the recommendations as well as certain key issues, receiving over 300 responses.\nThis final report reflects the Task Force’s consideration of industry and other public feedback\nreceived throughout 2016 and 2017. Section E contains a summary of key issues raised by the\nindustry as well as substantive changes to the report since December.\nDisclosure in Mainstream Financial Filings\nThe Task Force recommends that preparers of climate-related financial disclosures provide such\ndisclosures in their mainstream (i.e., public) annual financial filings. In most G20 jurisdictions,\ncompanies with public debt or equity have a legal obligation to disclose material information in\ntheir financial filings—including material climate-related information. The Task Force believes\nclimate-related issues are or could be material for many organizations, and its recommendations\nshould be useful to organizations in complying more effectively with existing disclosure\nobligations.4 In addition, disclosure in mainstream financial filings should foster shareholder\nengagement and broader use of climate-related financial disclosures, thus promoting a more\ninformed understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities by investors and others. The\nTask Force also believes that publication of climate-related financial information in mainstream\nannual financial filings will help ensure that appropriate controls govern the production and\ndisclosure of the required information. More specifically, the Task Force expects the governance\nprocesses for these disclosures would be similar to those used for existing public financial\ndisclosures and would likely involve review by the chief financial officer and audit committee, as\nappropriate.\nImportantly, organizations should make financial disclosures in accordance with their national\ndisclosure requirements. If certain elements of the recommendations are incompatible with\nnational disclosure requirements for financial filings, the Task Force encourages organizations to\ndisclose those elements in other official company reports that are issued at least annually, widely\ndistributed and available to investors and others, and subject to internal governance processes\nthat are the same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting.\nCore Elements of Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\nThe Task Force structured its recommendations around four thematic areas that represent core\nelements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and\ntargets (Figure 2, p. v). The four overarching recommendations are supported by recommended\ndisclosures that build out the framework with information that will help investors and others\nunderstand how reporting organizations assess climate-related risks and opportunities.5 In\naddition, there is guidance to support all organizations in developing climate-related financial\ndisclosures consistent with the recommendations and recommended disclosures. The guidance\nassists preparers by providing context and suggestions for implementing the recommended\ndisclosures. For the financial sector and certain non-financial sectors, supplemental guidance was\ndeveloped to highlight important sector-specific considerations and provide a fuller picture of\npotential climate-related financial impacts in those sectors.\n3 See Appendix 2: Task Force Objectives and Approach for more information.\n4 The Task Force encourages organizations where climate-related issues could be material in the future to begin disclosing climate-related\nfinancial information outside financial filings to facilitate the incorporation of such information into financial filings once climate-related\nissues are determined to be material.\n5 See Figure 4 on p. 14 for the Task Force's recommendations and recommended disclosures.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures iv",

The Task Force recognizes the use of\nscenarios in assessing climate-related issues and their potential financial implications is relatively\nrecent and practices will evolve over time, but believes such analysis is important for improving\nthe disclosure of decision-useful, climate-related financial information.\nConclusion\nRecognizing that climate-related financial reporting is still evolving, the Task Force’s\nrecommendations provide a foundation to improve investors’ and others’ ability to appropriately\nassess and price climate-related risk and opportunities. The Task Force’s recommendations aim to\nbe ambitious, but also practical for near-term adoption. The Task Force expects to advance the\nquality of mainstream financial disclosures related to the potential effects of climate change on\norganizations today and in the future and to increase investor engagement with boards and\nsenior management on climate-related issues.\nImproving the quality of climate-related financial disclosures begins with organizations’\nwillingness to adopt the Task Force’s recommendations. Organizations already reporting climate-\nrelated information under other frameworks may be able to disclose under this framework\nimmediately and are strongly encouraged to do so. Those organizations in early stages of\nevaluating the impact of climate change on their businesses and strategies can begin by\ndisclosing climate-related issues as they relate to governance, strategy, and risk management\npractices. The Task Force recognizes the challenges associated with measuring the impact of\nclimate change, but believes that by moving climate-related issues into mainstream annual\nfinancial filings, practices and techniques will evolve more rapidly. Improved practices and\ntechniques, including data analytics, should further improve the quality of climate-related\nfinancial disclosures and, ultimately, support more appropriate pricing of risks and allocation of\ncapital in the global economy.\n6 A 2° Celsius (2°C) scenario lays out an energy system deployment pathway and an emissions trajectory consistent with limiting the global\naverage temperature increase to 2°C above the pre-industrial average. The Task Force is not recommending organizations use a specific 2°C\nscenario.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures v",

    "content": "A Introduction\n1. Background\nIt is widely recognized that continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming of\nthe Earth and that warming above 2° Celsius (2°C), relative to the pre-industrial period, could lead\nto catastrophic economic and social consequences.7 As evidence of the growing recognition of the\nrisks posed by climate change, in December 2015, nearly 200 governments agreed to strengthen\nthe global response to the threat of climate change by “holding the increase in the global average\ntemperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the\ntemperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,” referred to as the Paris Agreement.8\nThe large-scale and long-term nature of the problem makes it uniquely challenging, especially in\nthe context of economic decision making. Moreover, the current understanding of the potential\nfinancial risks posed by climate change—to companies, investors, and the financial system as a\nwhole—is still at an early stage.\nThere is a growing demand for decision-useful, climate-related information by a range of\nA participants in the financial markets.9 Creditors and investors are increasingly demanding access\nIntroduction to risk information that is consistent, comparable, reliable, and clear. There has also been\nincreased focus, especially since the financial crisis of 2007-2008, on the negative impact that\nB\nweak corporate governance can have on shareholder value, resulting in increased demand for\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and transparency from organizations on their risks and risk management practices, including those\nFinancial Impacts\nrelated to climate change.\nC\nThe growing demand for decision-useful, climate-related information has resulted in the\nRecommendations and\nGuidance development of several climate-related disclosure standards. Many of the existing standards,\nhowever, focus on disclosure of climate-related information, such as greenhouse gas (GHG)\nD\nemissions and other sustainability metrics. Users of such climate-related disclosures commonly\nScenario Analysis and\ncite the lack of information on the financial implications around the climate-related aspects of an\nClimate-Related Issues\norganization's business as a key gap. Users also cite inconsistencies in disclosure practices, a lack\nE of context for information, use of boilerplate, and non-comparable reporting as major obstacles\nKey Issues Considered and\nto incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities (collectively referred to as climate-related\nAreas for Further Work\nissues) as considerations in their investment, lending, and insurance underwriting decisions over\nF the medium and long term.10 In addition, evidence suggests that the lack of consistent\nConclusion information hinders investors and others from considering climate-related issues in their asset\nvaluation and allocation processes.11\nAppendices\nIn general, inadequate information about risks can lead to a mispricing of assets and\nmisallocation of capital and can potentially give rise to concerns about financial stability since\nmarkets can be vulnerable to abrupt corrections.12 Recognizing these concerns, the G20 (Group of\n20) Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the Financial Stability Board\n(FSB) “convene public- and private-sector participants to review how the financial sector can take\naccount of climate-related issues.”13 In response to the G20’s request, the FSB held a meeting of\npublic- and private-sector representatives in September 2015 to consider the implications of\nclimate-related issues for the financial sector. “Participants exchanged views on the existing work\nof the financial sector, authorities, and standard setters in this area and the challenges they face,\n7 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fifth Assessment Report, Cambridge University Press, 2014.\n8 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, ”The Paris Agreement,” December 2015.\n9 Avery Fellow, “Investors Demand Climate Risk Disclosure,” Bloomberg, February 2013.\n10 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), SASB Climate Risk Technical Bulletin#: TB001-10182016, October 2016.\n11 Mercer LLC, Investing in a Time of Climate Change, 2015.\n12 Mark Carney, “Breaking the tragedy of the horizon—climate change and financial stability,” September 29, 2015.\n13 “Communiqué from the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Washington, D.C. April 16-17, 2015,” April 2015.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 1\n\nareas for possible further work, and the possible roles the FSB and others could play in taking\nthat work forward. The discussions continually returned to a common theme: the need for better\ninformation.”14\nIn most G20 jurisdictions, companies with public debt or equity have a legal obligation to disclose\nmaterial risks in their financial reports—including material climate-related risks. However, the\nabsence of a standardized framework for disclosing climate-related financial risks makes it\ndifficult for organizations to determine what information should be included in their filings and\nhow it should be presented. Even when reporting similar climate-related information, disclosures\nare often difficult to compare due to variances in mandatory and voluntary frameworks. The\nresulting fragmentation in reporting practices and lack of focus on financial impacts have\nprevented investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other users of disclosures from\naccessing complete information that can inform their economic decisions. Furthermore, because\nfinancial-sector organizations’ disclosures depend, in part, on those from the companies in which\nthey invest or lend, regulators face challenges in using financial-sector organizations’ existing\ndisclosures to determine system-wide exposures to climate-related risks.\nIn response, the FSB established the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nA\nDisclosures (TCFD or Task Force) in December 2015 to design a set of recommendations for\nIntroduction\nconsistent “disclosures that will help financial market participants understand their climate-\nB related risks.”15 See Box 1 (p. 3) for more information on the Task Force.\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\n2. The Task Force’s Remit\nC\nThe FSB called on the Task Force to develop climate-related disclosures that “could promote more\nRecommendations and\ninformed investment, credit [or lending], and insurance underwriting decisions” and, in turn,\nGuidance\n“would enable stakeholders to understand better the concentrations of carbon-related assets in\nD the financial sector and the financial system’s exposures to climate-related risks.”16,17 The FSB\nScenario Analysis and\nnoted that disclosures by the financial sector in particular would “foster an early assessment of\nClimate-Related Issues\nthese risks” and “facilitate market discipline.” Such disclosures would also “provide a source of\nE data that can be analyzed at a systemic level, to facilitate authorities’ assessments of the\nKey Issues Considered and materiality of any risks posed by climate change to the financial sector, and the channels through\nAreas for Further Work\nwhich this is most likely to be transmitted.”18\nF\nThe FSB also emphasized that “any disclosure recommendations by the Task Force would be\nConclusion\nvoluntary, would need to incorporate the principle of materiality and would need to weigh the\nAppendices balance of costs and benefits.”19 As a result, in devising a principle-based framework for voluntary\ndisclosure, the Task Force sought to balance the needs of the users of disclosures with the\nchallenges faced by the preparers. The FSB further stated that the Task Force’s climate-related\nfinancial disclosure recommendations should not “add to the already well developed body of\nexisting disclosure schemes.”20 In response, the Task Force drew from existing disclosure\nframeworks where possible and appropriate.\nThe FSB also noted the Task Force should determine whether the target audience of users of\nclimate-related financial disclosures should extend beyond investors, lenders, and insurance\nunderwriters. Investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters (“primary users”) are the\nappropriate target audience. These primary users assume the financial risk and reward of the\n14 FSB, “FSB to establish Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures,” December 4, 2015.\n15 Ibid.\n16 FSB, “Proposal for a Disclosure Task Force on Climate-Related Risks,” November 9, 2015.\n17 The term carbon-related assets is not well defined, but is generally considered to refer to assets or organizations with relatively high direct or\nindirect GHG emissions.

The Task Force recognizes that many other organizations, including credit\nrating agencies, equity analysts, stock exchanges, investment consultants, and proxy advisors also\nuse climate-related financial disclosures, allowing them to push information through the credit\nand investment chain and contribute to the better pricing of risks by investors, lenders, and\ninsurance underwriters. These organizations, in principle, depend on the same types of\ninformation as primary users.\nThis report presents the Task Force’s recommendations for climate-related financial disclosures\nand includes supporting information on climate-related risks and opportunities, scenario analysis,\nand industry feedback that the Task Force considered in developing and then finalizing its\nrecommendations.

An\nimportant element of such a framework is the consistent categorization of climate-related risks\nand opportunities. As a result, the Task Force defined categories for climate-related risks and\nclimate-related opportunities. The Task Force’s recommendations serve to encourage\norganizations to evaluate and disclose, as part of their annual financial filing preparation and\nreporting processes, the climate-related risks and opportunities that are most pertinent to their\nA\nIntroduction business activities. The main climate-related risks and opportunities that organizations should\nconsider are described below and in Tables 1 and 2 (pp. 10-11).\nB\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts 1. Climate-Related Risks\nThe Task Force divided climate-related risks into two major categories: (1) risks related to the\nC\ntransition to a lower-carbon economy and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate\nRecommendations and\nGuidance change.\nD\na. Transition Risks\nScenario Analysis and\nTransitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and\nClimate-Related Issues\nmarket changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change.\nE Depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying\nKey Issues Considered and\nlevels of financial and reputational risk to organizations.\nAreas for Further Work\nPolicy and Legal Risks\nF\nConclusion Policy actions around climate change continue to evolve. Their objectives generally fall into two\ncategories—policy actions that attempt to constrain actions that contribute to the adverse effects\nAppendices\nof climate change or policy actions that seek to promote adaptation to climate change. Some\nexamples include implementing carbon-pricing mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions, shifting\nenergy use toward lower emission sources, adopting energy-efficiency solutions, encouraging\ngreater water efficiency measures, and promoting more sustainable land-use practices. The risk\nassociated with and financial impact of policy changes depend on the nature and timing of the\npolicy change.21\nAnother important risk is litigation or legal risk. Recent years have seen an increase in climate-\nrelated litigation claims being brought before the courts by property owners, municipalities,\nstates, insurers, shareholders, and public interest organizations.22 Reasons for such litigation\ninclude the failure of organizations to mitigate impacts of climate change, failure to adapt to\nclimate change, and the insufficiency of disclosure around material financial risks. As the value of\nloss and damage arising from climate change grows, litigation risk is also likely to increase.\n21 Organizations should assess not only the potential direct effects of policy actions on their operations, but also the potential second and third\norder effects on their supply and distribution chains.\n22 Peter Seley, “Emerging Trends in Climate Change Litigation,” Law 360, March 7, 2016.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 5",

    "content": "Technology Risk\nTechnological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower-carbon, energy-\nefficient economic system can have a significant impact on organizations. For example, the\ndevelopment and use of emerging technologies such as renewable energy, battery storage,\nenergy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage will affect the competitiveness of certain\norganizations, their production and distribution costs, and ultimately the demand for their\nproducts and services from end users. To the extent that new technology displaces old systems\nand disrupts some parts of the existing economic system, winners and losers will emerge from\nthis “creative destruction” process. The timing of technology development and deployment,\nhowever, is a key uncertainty in assessing technology risk.\nMarket Risk\nWhile the ways in which markets could be affected by climate change are varied and complex,\none of the major ways is through shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products,\nand services as climate-related risks and opportunities are increasingly taken into account.\nReputation Risk\nClimate change has been identified as a potential source of reputational risk tied to changing\nA\ncustomer or community perceptions of an organization’s contribution to or detraction from the\nIntroduction\ntransition to a lower-carbon economy.\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, b.

Climate-Related Opportunities\nEfforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change also produce opportunities for organizations, for\nexample, through resource efficiency and cost savings, the adoption of low-emission energy\nsources, the development of new products and services, access to new markets, and building\nresilience along the supply chain. Climate-related opportunities will vary depending on the region,\nmarket, and industry in which an organization operates. The Task Force identified several areas of\nopportunity as described below.\na. Resource Efficiency\nThere is growing evidence and examples of organizations that have successfully reduced\noperating costs by improving efficiency across their production and distribution processes,\nbuildings, machinery/appliances, and transport/mobility—in particular in relation to energy\nefficiency but also including broader materials, water, and waste management.23 Such actions can\n23 UNEP and Copenhagen Centre for Energy Efficiency, Best Practices and Case Studies for Industrial Energy Efficiency Improvement, February 16,\n2016.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 6\n\nresult in direct cost savings to organizations’ operations over the medium to long term and\ncontribute to the global efforts to curb emissions.24 Innovation in technology is assisting this\ntransition; such innovation includes developing efficient heating solutions and circular economy\nsolutions, making advances in LED lighting technology and industrial motor technology,\nretrofitting buildings, employing geothermal power, offering water usage and treatment\nsolutions, and developing electric vehicles.25\nb. Energy Source\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to meet global emission-reduction goals,\ncountries will need to transition a major percentage of their energy generation to low emission\nalternatives such as wind, solar, wave, tidal, hydro, geothermal, nuclear, biofuels, and carbon\ncapture and storage.26 For the fifth year in a row, investments in renewable energy capacity have\nexceeded investments in fossil fuel generation.27 The trend toward decentralized clean energy\nsources, rapidly declining costs, improved storage capabilities, and subsequent global adoption of\nthese technologies are significant. Organizations that shift their energy usage toward low\nemission energy sources could potentially save on annual energy costs.28\nc. Products and Services\nA\nIntroduction Organizations that innovate and develop new low-emission products and services may improve\ntheir competitive position and capitalize on shifting consumer and producer preferences. Some\nB examples include consumer goods and services that place greater emphasis on a product’s\nClimate-Related Risks,\ncarbon footprint in its marketing and labeling (e.g., travel, food, beverage and consumer staples,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts mobility, printing, fashion, and recycling services) and producer goods that place emphasis on\nreducing emissions (e.g., adoption of energy-efficiency measures along the supply chain).\nC\nRecommendations and\nd.

Resilience\nAppendices\nThe concept of climate resilience involves organizations developing adaptive capacity to respond\nto climate change to better manage the associated risks and seize opportunities, including the\nability to respond to transition risks and physical risks. Opportunities include improving efficiency,\ndesigning new production processes, and developing new products. Opportunities related to\nresilience may be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed assets or extensive\nsupply or distribution networks; those that depend critically on utility and infrastructure networks\nor natural resources in their value chain; and those that may require longer-term financing and\ninvestment.\n24 Environmental Protection Agency Victoria (EPA Victoria), “Resource Efficiency Case Studies: Lower your Impact.”\n25 As described by Pearce and Turner, circular economy refers to a system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are\nminimized. This can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. This is\nin contrast to a linear economy which is a “take, make, dispose” model of production.\n26 IEA, “Global energy investment down 8% in 2015 with flows signaling move towards cleaner energy,” September 14, 2016.\n27 Frankfurt School-United Nations Environmental Programme Centre and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, “Global Trends in Renewable Energy\nInvestment 2017,” 2017.\n28 Ceres, “Power Forward 3.0: How the largest US companies are capturing business value while addressing climate change,” 2017.\n29 G20 Green Finance Study Group.

Financial Impacts\nBetter disclosure of the financial impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on an\norganization is a key goal of the Task Force’s work. In order to make more informed financial\ndecisions, investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters need to understand how climate-related\nrisks and opportunities are likely to impact an organization’s future financial position as reflected\nin its income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet as outlined in Figure 1. While\nclimate change affects nearly all economic sectors, the level and type of exposure and the impact\nof climate-related risks differs by sector, industry, geography, and organization.30\nFigure 1\nClimate-Related Risks, Opportunities, and Financial Impact\nTransition Risks\nOpportunities\nPolicy and Legal\nResource Efficiency\nTechnology\nEnergy Source\nMarket\nRisks Opportunities Products/Services\nReputation\nA\nMarkets\nI ntroduction P Ah cy us ti ec al Risks\nStrategic Planning Resilience\nRisk Management\nB\nChronic\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impact\nFinancial Impacts\nC\nR Ge uc ido am nm cee ndations and R Exe pve en nu de its\nu res\nStI an tc eo mm ee\nn t\nSC ta as th\ne\nmFl eo nw\nt\nB Sa hla en ec te CA ass pe itt as\nl\n&\n&\nL Fi ia nb ai nlit ci ie ns\ng\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues Fundamentally, the financial impacts of climate-related issues on an organization are driven by\nthe specific climate-related risks and opportunities to which the organization is exposed and its\nE\nKey Issues Considered and strategic and risk management decisions on managing those risks (i.e., mitigate, transfer, accept,\nAreas for Further Work or control) and seizing those opportunities. The Task Force has identified four major categories,\ndescribed in Figure 2 (p. 9), through which climate-related risks and opportunities may affect an\nF\norganization’s current and future financial positions.\nConclusion\nAppendices The financial impacts of climate-related issues on organizations are not always clear or direct,\nand, for many organizations, identifying the issues, assessing potential impacts, and ensuring\nmaterial issues are reflected in financial filings may be challenging. Key reasons for this are likely\nbecause of (1) limited knowledge of climate-related issues within organizations; (2) the tendency\nto focus mainly on near-term risks without paying adequate attention to risks that may arise in\nthe longer term; and (3) the difficulty in quantifying the financial effects of climate-related issues.31\nTo assist organizations in identifying climate-related issues and their impacts, the Task Force\ndeveloped Table 1 (p. 10), which provides examples of climate-related risks and their potential\nfinancial impacts, and Table 2 (p. 11), which provides examples of climate-related opportunities\nand their potential financial impacts. In addition, Section A.4 in the Annex provides more\ninformation on the major categories of financial impacts—revenues, expenditures, assets and\nliabilities, and capital and financing—that are likely to be most relevant for specific industries.\n30 SASB research demonstrates that 72 out of 79 Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS™) industries are significantly affected in some\nway by climate-related risk.\n31 World Business Council for Sustainable Development, “Sustainability and enterprise risk management: The first step towards integration.”\nJanuary 18, 2017.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 8\n\nFigure 2\nMajor Categories of Financial Impact\nIncome Statement Balance Sheet\nRevenues.

Overview of Recommendations and Guidance\nTo fulfill its remit, the Task Force developed four widely adoptable recommendations on climate-\nrelated financial disclosures applicable to organizations across sectors and jurisdictions. In\ndeveloping its recommendations, the Task Force considered the challenges for preparers of\ndisclosures as well as the benefits of such disclosures to investors, lenders, and insurance\nunderwriters. To achieve this balance, the Task Force engaged in significant outreach and\nconsultation with users and preparers of disclosures and drew upon existing climate-related\ndisclosure regimes. The insights gained from the outreach and consultations directly informed\nthe development of the recommendations.\nThe Task Force structured its recommendations around four thematic areas that represent core\nelements of how organizations operate—governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics\nand targets. The four overarching recommendations are supported by key climate-related\nfinancial disclosures—referred to as recommended disclosures—that build out the framework\nA with information that will help investors and others understand how reporting organizations think\nIntroduction about and assess climate-related risks and opportunities. In addition, there is guidance to support\nall organizations in developing climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the\nB\nrecommendations and recommended disclosures as well as supplemental guidance for specific\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and sectors. The structure is depicted in Figure 3 below, and the Task Force’s recommendations and\nFinancial Impacts\nsupporting recommended disclosures are presented in Figure 4 (p. 14).\nC\nRecommendations and\nFigure 3\nGuidance\nRecommendations and Guidance\nD\nScenario Analysis and Recommendations\nClimate-Related Issues Four widely adoptable recommendations tied to:\nRecommendations governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics\nE and targets\nKey Issues Considered and Recommended Disclosures\nAreas for Further Work Specific recommended disclosures organizations should\ninclude in their financial filings to provide decision-\nF useful information\nConclusion Guidance for\nGuidance for All Sectors\nAll Sectors\nGuidance providing context and suggestions for\nAppendices\nimplementing the recommended disclosures for all\nRecommended organizations\nDisclosures\nSupplemental Guidance for Certain Sectors\nGuidance that highlights important considerations for\nSupplemental certain sectors and provides a fuller picture of potential\nclimate-related financial impacts in those sectors\nGuidance for\nCertain Sectors Supplemental guidance is provided for the financial\nsector and for non-financial sectors potentially most\naffected by climate change\nThe Task Force’s supplemental guidance is included in the Annex and covers the financial sector\nas well as non-financial industries potentially most affected by climate change and the transition\nto a lower-carbon economy (referred to as non-financial groups). The supplemental guidance\nprovides these preparers with additional context and suggestions for implementing the\nrecommended disclosures and should be used in conjunction with the guidance for all sectors.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 13\n\nFigure 4\nRecommendations and Supporting Recommended Disclosures\nGovernance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nDisclose the organization’s Disclose the actual and potential Disclose how the organization Disclose the metrics and targets\ngovernance around climate- impacts of climate-related risks identifies, assesses, and manages used to assess and manage\nrelated risks and opportunities. and opportunities on the climate-related risks. relevant climate-related risks and\norganization’s businesses, opportunities where such\nstrategy, and financial planning information is material.\nwhere such information is\nmaterial.\nRecommended Disclosures Recommended Disclosures Recommended Disclosures Recommended Disclosures\na) Describe the board’s oversight a) Describe the climate-related a) Describe the organization’s a) Disclose the metrics used by the\nof climate-related risks and risks and opportunities the processes for identifying and organization to assess climate-\nopportunities. organization has identified over assessing climate-related risks. related risks and opportunities\nthe short, medium, and long in line with its strategy and risk\nterm. management process.\nb) Describe management’s role in b) Describe the impact of climate- b) Describe the organization’s b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and,\nassessing and managing related risks and opportunities processes for managing if appropriate, Scope 3\nclimate-related risks and on the organization’s climate-related risks. greenhouse gas (GHG)\nopportunities. businesses, strategy, and emissions, and the related risks.\nfinancial planning.\nc) Describe the resilience of the c) Describe how processes for c) Describe the targets used by\norganization’s strategy, taking identifying, assessing, and the organization to manage\ninto consideration different managing climate-related risks climate-related risks and\nclimate-related scenarios, are integrated into the opportunities and performance\nincluding a 2°C or lower organization’s overall risk against targets.\nscenario. management.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 14\n\nFigure 5 provides a mapping of the recommendations (governance, strategy, risk management,\nand metrics and targets) and recommended disclosures (a, b, c) for which supplemental guidance\nwas developed for the financial sector and non-financial groups.\n Financial Sector. The Task Force developed supplemental guidance for the financial sector,\nwhich it organized into four major industries largely based on activities performed. The four\nindustries are banks (lending), insurance companies (underwriting), asset managers (asset\nmanagement), and asset owners, which include public- and private-sector pension plans,\nendowments, and foundations (investing).34 The Task Force believes that disclosures by the\nfinancial sector could foster an early assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities,\nimprove pricing of climate-related risks, and lead to more informed capital allocation\ndecisions.\n Non-Financial Groups. The Task Force developed supplemental guidance for non-financial\nindustries that account for the largest proportion of GHG emissions, energy usage, and water\nusage. These industries were organized into four groups (i.e., non-financial groups)—Energy;\nMaterials and Buildings; Transportation; and Agriculture, Food, and Forest Products—based\non similarities in climate-related risks as shown in Box 2 (p. 16). While this supplemental\nA guidance focuses on a subset of non-financial industries, organizations in other industries\nIntroduction with similar business activities may wish to review and consider the issues and topics\ncontained in the supplemental guidance.\nB\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts Figure 5\nSupplemental Guidance for Financial Sector and Non-Financial\nC\nRecommendations and Groups\nGuidance\nGovernance Strategy\nRisk Metrics and\nD Management Targets\nScenario Analysis and Industries and Groups a) b) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c)\nClimate-Related Issues\nBanks\nE\nKey Issues Considered and al Insurance Companies\nAreas for Further Work\nnci\nna\nAsset Owners\nF\nFi\nConclusion Asset Managers\nAppendices Energy\nal\nci Transportation\nn\na\nn\nFi Materials and Buildings\n-n\no\nN\nAgriculture, Food, and\nForest Products\n34 The use of the term “insurance companies” in this report includes re-insurers.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 15\n\nBox 2\nDetermination of Non-Financial Groups\nIn an effort to focus supplemental guidance on those non-financial sectors and industries with the highest\nlikelihood of climate-related financial impacts, the Task Force assessed three factors most likely to be affected by\nboth transition risk (policy and legal,technology, market, and reputation) and physical risk (acute and chronic)—\nGHG emissions, energy usage, and water usage.\nThe underlying premise in using these three factors is that climate-related physical and transition risks will likely\nmanifest themselves primarily and broadly in the form of constraints on GHG emissions, effects on energy\nproduction and usage, and effects on water availability, usage, and quality. Other factors, such as waste\nmanagement and land use, are also important, but may not be as determinative across a wide range of industries\nor may be captured in one of the primary categories.\nIn taking this approach, the Task Force consulted a number of sources regarding the ranking of various sectors and\nindustries according to these three factors. The various rankings were used to determine an overall set of sectors\nand industries that have significant exposure to transition or physical risks related to GHG emissions, energy, or\nwater. The sectors and industries were grouped into four categories of industries that have similar economic\nactivities and climate-related exposures.\nThese four groups and their associated industries are intended to be indicative of the economic activities\nassociated with these industries rather than definitive industry categories. Other industries with similar activities\nand climate-related exposures should consider the supplemental guidance as well.\nThe Task Force validated its approach using a variety of sources, including:\nThe TCFD Phase I report public consultation, soliciting more than 200 responses which ranked Energy, Utilities,\nMaterials, Industrials and Consumer Staples/Discretionary, in that order, as the Global Industry Classification\nStandard (GICS) sectors most important for disclosure guidelines to cover.\nNumerous sector-specific disclosure guidance documents to understand various breakdowns by economic\nactivity, sector, and industries, including from the following sources: CDP, GHG Protocol, Global Real Estate\nSustainability Benchmark (GRESB), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Institutional Investors Group on Climate\nChange (IIGCC), IPIECA (the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues), and the\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report “Climate Change 2014 – Mitigation of Climate\nChange” that provides an analysis of global direct and indirect emissions by economic sector. The IPCC analysis\nhighlights the dominant emissions-producing sectors as Energy; Industry; Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land\nUse; and Transportation and Buildings (Commercial and Residential).\nResearch and documentation from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and industry organizations that\nprovide information on which industries have the highest exposures to climate change, including those from\nCambridge Institute of Sustainability Leadership, China’s National Development and Reform Commission\n(NDRC), Environmental Resources Management (ERM), IEA, Moody’s, S&P Global Ratings, and WRI/UNEPFI.\nBased on its assessment, the Task Force identified the four groups and their associated industries, listed in the\ntable below, as those that would most benefit from supplemental guidance.\nEnergy Transportation Materials and Agriculture, Food,\nBuildings and Forest Products\n‒ Oil and Gas ‒ Air Freight ‒ Metals and Mining ‒ Beverages\n‒ Coal ‒ Passenger Air ‒ Chemicals ‒ Agriculture\n‒ Electric Utilities Transportation ‒ Construction Materials ‒ Packaged Foods and\n‒ Maritime Transportation ‒ Capital Goods Meats\n‒ Rail Transportation ‒ Real Estate ‒ Paper and Forest\n‒ Trucking Services Management and Products\n‒ Automobiles and Development\nComponents\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 16\n\n2. Implementing the Recommendations\na. Scope of Coverage\nTo promote more informed investing, lending, and insurance underwriting decisions, the Task\nForce recommends all organizations with public debt or equity implement its recommendations.\nBecause climate-related issues are relevant for other types of organizations as well, the Task\nForce encourages all organizations to implement these recommendations. In particular, the Task\nForce believes that asset managers and asset owners, including public- and private-sector\npension plans, endowments, and foundations, should implement its recommendations so that\ntheir clients and beneficiaries may better understand the performance of their assets, consider\nthe risks of their investments, and make more informed investment choices.\nb. Location of Disclosures and Materiality\nThe Task Force recommends that organizations provide climate-related financial disclosures in\ntheir mainstream (i.e., public) annual financial filings.35 In most G20 jurisdictions, public\ncompanies have a legal obligation to disclose material information in their financial filings—\nincluding material climate-related information; and the Task Force’s recommendations are\nA intended to help organizations meet existing disclosure obligations more effectively.36 The Task\nIntroduction Force’s recommendations were developed to apply broadly across sectors and jurisdictions and\nshould not be seen as superseding national disclosure requirements. Importantly, organizations\nB\nshould make financial disclosures in accordance with their national disclosure requirements. If\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and certain elements of the recommendations are incompatible with national disclosure\nFinancial Impacts requirements for financial filings, the Task Force encourages organizations to disclose those\nelements in other official company reports that are issued at least annually, widely distributed\nC\nand available to investors and others, and subject to internal governance processes that are the\nRecommendations and\nGuidance same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting.\nD The Task Force recognizes that most information included in financial filings is subject to a\nScenario Analysis and\nmateriality assessment. However, because climate-related risk is a non-diversifiable risk that\nClimate-Related Issues\naffects nearly all industries, many investors believe it requires special attention. For example, in\nE assessing organizations’ financial and operating results, many investors want insight into the\nKey Issues Considered and governance and risk management context in which such results are achieved. The Task Force\nAreas for Further Work\nbelieves disclosures related to its Governance and Risk Management recommendations directly\naddress this need for context and should be included in annual financial filings.\nF\nConclusion\nFor disclosures related to the Strategy and Metrics and Targets recommendations, the Task Force\nAppendices believes organizations should provide such information in annual financial filings when the\ninformation is deemed material. Certain organizations—those in the four non-financial groups\nthat have more than one billion U.S. dollar equivalent (USDE) in annual revenue—should consider\ndisclosing such information in other reports when the information is not deemed material and\nnot included in financial filings.37 Because these organizations are more likely than others to be\nfinancially impacted over time, investors are interested in monitoring how these organizations’\nstrategies evolve.\n35 Financial filings refer to the annual reporting packages in which organizations are required to deliver their audited financial results under the\ncorporate, compliance, or securities laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. While reporting requirements differ internationally,\nfinancial filings generally contain financial statements and other information such as governance statements and management commentary.\n36 The Task Force encourages organizations where climate-related issues could be material in the future to begin disclosing climate-related\nfinancial information outside financial filings to facilitate the incorporation of such information into financial filings once climate-related\nissues are determined to be material.\n37 The Task Force chose a one billion USDE annual revenue threshold because it captures organizations responsible for over 90 percent of\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in the industries represented by the four non-financial groups (about 2,250 organizations out of roughly\n15,000).\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 17",

    "content": "The Task Force recognizes reporting by asset managers and asset owners is intended to satisfy\nthe needs of clients, beneficiaries, regulators, and oversight bodies and follows a format that is\ngenerally different from corporate financial reporting. For purposes of adopting the Task Force’s\nrecommendations, asset managers and asset owners should use their existing means of financial\nreporting to their clients and beneficiaries where relevant and where feasible. Likewise, asset\nmanagers and asset owners should consider materiality in the context of their respective\nmandates and investment performance for clients and beneficiaries.38\nThe Task Force believes that climate-related financial disclosures should be subject to appropriate\ninternal governance processes. Since these disclosures should be included in annual financial\nfilings, the governance processes should be similar to those used for existing financial reporting\nand would likely involve review by the chief financial officer and audit committee, as appropriate.\nThe Task Force recognizes that some organizations may provide some or all of their climate-\nrelated financial disclosures in reports other than financial filings. This may occur because the\norganizations are not required to issue public financial reports (e.g., some asset managers and\nasset owners). In such situations, organizations should follow internal governance processes that\nare the same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting.\nA\nIntroduction c.

However, for\nmany organizations, the most significant effects of climate change are likely to emerge over the\nmedium to longer term and their timing and magnitude are uncertain. This uncertainty presents\nchallenges for individual organizations in understanding the potential effects of climate change\non their businesses, strategies, and financial performance. To appropriately incorporate the\npotential effects in their planning processes, organizations need to consider how their climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities may evolve and the potential implications under different\nconditions. One way to do this is through scenario analysis.\nScenario analysis is a well-established method for developing strategic plans that are more\nflexible or robust to a range of plausible future states. The use of scenario analysis for assessing\nthe potential business implications of climate-related risks and opportunities, however, is\nrelatively recent. While several organizations use scenario analysis to assess the potential impact\nof climate change on their businesses, only a subset have disclosed their assessment of forward-\nlooking implications publicly, either in sustainability reports or financial filings.42\nA\nIntroduction The disclosure of organizations’ forward-looking assessments of climate-related issues is\nimportant for investors and other stakeholders in understanding how vulnerable individual\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, organizations are to transition and physical risks and how such vulnerabilities are or would be\nOpportunities, and addressed. As a result, the Task Force believes that organizations should use scenario analysis to\nFinancial Impacts\nassess potential business, strategic, and financial implications of climate-related risks and\nopportunities and disclose those, as appropriate, in their annual financial filings.\nC\nRecommendations and\nGuidance\nScenario analysis is an important and useful tool for understanding the\nD\nstrategic implications of climate-related risks and opportunities.\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues\nThis section provides additional information on using scenario analysis as a tool to assess\nE\npotential implications of climate-related risks and opportunities. In addition, a technical\nKey Issues Considered and\nAreas for Further Work supplement, The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks and\nOpportunities, on the Task Force’s website provides further information on the types of climate-\nF\nrelated scenarios, the application of scenario analysis, and the key challenges in implementing\nConclusion\nscenario analysis.\nAppendices\n1. Overview of Scenario Analysis\nScenario analysis is a process for identifying and assessing the potential implications of a range of\nplausible future states under conditions of uncertainty. Scenarios are hypothetical constructs and\nnot designed to deliver precise outcomes or forecasts. Instead, scenarios provide a way for\norganizations to consider how the future might look if certain trends continue or certain\nconditions are met. In the case of climate change, for example, scenarios allow an organization to\nexplore and develop an understanding of how various combinations of climate-related risks, both\ntransition and physical risks, may affect its businesses, strategies, and financial performance over\ntime.\nScenario analysis can be qualitative, relying on descriptive, written narratives, or quantitative,\nrelying on numerical data and models, or some combination of both. Qualitative scenario analysis\n42 Some organizations in the energy sector and some large investors have made public disclosures describing the results of their climate-related\nscenario analysis, including discussing how the transition might affect their current portfolios. In some instances, this information was\npublished in financial filings.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 25",

Exposure to Climate-Related Risks\nThe effects of climate change on specific sectors, industries, and individual organizations are\nhighly variable. It is important, therefore, that all organizations consider applying a basic level of\nscenario analysis in their strategic planning and risk management processes. Organizations more\nsignificantly affected by transition risk (e.g., fossil fuel-based industries, energy-intensive\nmanufacturers, and transportation activities) and/or physical risk (e.g., agriculture, transportation\n43 For example, see Mark D.

Exposure to Transition Risks\nTransition risk scenarios are particularly relevant for resource-intensive organizations with high\nGHG emissions within their value chains, where policy actions, technology, or market changes\naimed at emissions reductions, energy efficiency, subsidies or taxes, or other constraints or\nincentives may have a particularly direct effect.\nA key type of transition risk scenario is a so-called 2°C scenario, which lays out a pathway and an\nemissions trajectory consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to\n2°C above pre-industrial levels. In December 2015, nearly 200 governments agreed to strengthen\nthe global response to the threat of climate change by “holding the increase in the global average\ntemperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the\ntemperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,” referred to as the Paris Agreement.45\nAs a result, a 2°C scenario provides a common reference point that is generally aligned with the\nobjectives of the Paris Agreement and will support investors’ evaluation of the potential\nmagnitude and timing of transition-related implications for individual organizations; across\nA different organizations within a sector; and across different sectors.\nIntroduction\nb.

Recommended Approach to Scenario Analysis\nThe Task Force believes that all organizations exposed to climate-related risks should consider (1)\nusing scenario analysis to help inform their strategic and financial planning processes and (2)\ndisclosing how resilient their strategies are to a range of plausible climate-related scenarios. The\nTask Force recognizes that, for many organizations, scenario analysis is or would be a largely\nqualitative exercise. However, organizations with more significant exposure to transition risk\nand/or physical risk should undertake more rigorous qualitative and, if relevant, quantitative\nscenario analysis with respect to key drivers and trends that affect their operations.\nA critical aspect of scenario analysis is the selection of a set of scenarios (not just one) that covers\na reasonable variety of future outcomes, both favorable and unfavorable. In this regard, the Task\nForce recommends organizations use a 2°C or lower scenario in addition to two or three other\n45 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ”The Paris Agreement,” December 2015.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 27",

Applying Scenario Analysis\nWhile the Task Force recognizes the complexities of scenario analysis and the potential resources\nneeded to conduct it, organizations are encouraged to use scenario analysis to assess climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities. For organizations just beginning to use scenario analysis, a\nqualitative approach that progresses and deepens over time may be appropriate.48 Greater rigor\nand sophistication in the use of data and quantitative models and analysis may be warranted for\norganizations with more extensive experience in conducting scenario analysis. Organizations may\ndecide to use existing external scenarios and models (e.g., those provided by third-party vendors)\nor develop their own, in-house modeling capabilities. The choice of approach will depend on an\norganization’s needs, resources, and capabilities.\nIn conducting scenario analysis, organizations should strive to achieve:\n transparency around parameters, assumptions, analytical approaches, and time frames;\n comparability of results across different scenarios and analytical approaches;\n adequate documentation for the methodology, assumptions, data sources, and analytics;\nA  consistency of methodology year over year;\nIntroduction\n sound governance over scenario analysis conduct, validation, approval, and application; and\nB\nClimate-Related Risks,  effective disclosure of scenario analysis that will inform and promote a constructive\nOpportunities, and dialogue between investors and organizations on the range of potential impacts and\nFinancial Impacts\nresilience of the organization’s strategy under various plausible climate-related scenarios.\nC\nIn applying scenario analysis, organizations should consider general implications for their\nRecommendations and\nGuidance strategies, capital allocation, and costs and revenues, both at an enterprise-wide level and at the\nlevel of specific regions and markets where specific implications of climate change for the\nD organization are likely to arise. Financial-sector organizations should consider using scenario\nScenario Analysis and\nanalysis to evaluate the potential impact of climate-related scenarios on individual assets or\nClimate-Related Issues\ninvestments, investments or assets in a particular sector or region, or underwriting activities.\nE\nKey Issues Considered and The Task Force’s supplemental guidance recognizes that organizations will be at different levels of\nAreas for Further Work\nexperience in using scenario analysis.

Challenges and Benefits of Conducting Scenario Analysis\nScenario analysis is a well-established method for developing strategic plans that are more\nflexible and robust to a range of plausible future states. As previously discussed (Figure 7, p. 26) it\nis particularly useful for assessing issues with possible outcomes that are highly uncertain, that\nplay out over the medium to longer term, and that are potentially disruptive. Scenario analysis\ncan help to better frame strategic issues, assess the range of potential management actions that\nmay be needed, engage more productively in strategic conversations, and identify indicators to\nmonitor the external environment. Importantly, climate-related scenario analysis can provide the\nfoundation for more effective engagement with investors on an organization’s strategic and\nbusiness resiliency.\nConducting climate-related scenario analysis, however, is not without challenges. First, most\nscenarios have been developed for global and macro assessments of potential climate-related\nimpacts that can inform policy makers. These climate-related scenarios do not always provide the\nideal level of transparency, range of data outputs, and functionality of tools that would facilitate\ntheir use in a business or investment context.\nSecond, the availability and granularity of data can be a challenge for organizations attempting to\nA\nIntroduction assess various energy and technology pathways or carbon constraints in different jurisdictions\nand geographic locations.\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, Third, the use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess potential business implications is still\nOpportunities, and\nat an early stage.

Sharing experiences and approaches to\nRecommendations and\nclimate-related scenario analysis across organizations, therefore, is critical to advancing the use of\nGuidance\nclimate-related scenario analysis. Organizations may be able to play an important role in this\nD regard by facilitating information and experience exchanges among themselves; collectively\nScenario Analysis and developing tools, data sets, and methodologies; and working to set standards.

The Task Force considered these issues and\nothers in developing and then finalizing its recommendations and sought to balance the burden\nof disclosure on preparers with the need for consistent and decision-useful information for users\n(i.e., investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters). This section describes the key issues\nconsidered by the Task Force, significant public feedback received by the Task Force related to\nthose issues, the ultimate disposition of the issues, and, in some cases, areas where further work\nmay be warranted. Figure 9 summarizes areas the Task Force identified, through its own analysis\nas well as through public feedback, as warranting further research and analysis or the\ndevelopment of methodologies and standards.\nA\nIntroduction Figure 9\nKey Areas for Further Work\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, Relationship to Encourage standard setting organizations and others to actively work\nOpportunities, and\nOther Reporting toward greater alignment of frameworks and to support adoption\nFinancial Impacts\nInitiatives\nC\nRecommendations and Scenario Analysis Further develop applicable 2°C or lower transition scenarios and\nGuidance supporting outputs, tools, and user interfaces\nD Develop broadly accepted methodologies, datasets, and tools for\nScenario Analysis and scenario-based evaluation of physical risk by organizations\nClimate-Related Issues\nMake datasets and tools publicly available and provide commonly\nE available platforms for scenario analysis\nKey Issues Considered\nand Areas for Further Data Availability Undertake further research and analysis to better understand and\nWork and Quality and measure how climate-related issues translate into potential financial\nFinancial Impact impacts for organizations in financial and non-financial sectors\nF\nConclusion Improve data quality and further develop standardized metrics for\nthe financial sector, including better defining carbon-related assets\nAppendices\nand developing metrics that address a broader range of climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities\nIncrease organizations’ understanding of climate-related risks and\nopportunities\nExample Provide example disclosures to assist preparers in developing\nDisclosures49 disclosures consistent with the Task Force’s recommendations\n49 In response to the second consultation, organizations asked for example disclosures to gain a better understanding of how the\nrecommended information may be disclosed. The Task Force acknowledges the development of these examples as an area of further work.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 32\n\n1. Relationship to Other Reporting Initiatives\nThrough the Task Force’s outreach efforts, some organizations expressed concern that multiple\ndisclosure frameworks and mandatory reporting requirements increase the administrative\nburden of disclosure efforts. Specifically, the additional time, cost, and effort required to analyze\nand disclose new climate-related information could penalize those with less capacity to respond.\nThe Task Force considered existing voluntary and mandatory climate-related reporting\nframeworks in developing its recommendations and provides information in the Annex on the\nalignment of existing frameworks, including those developed by the CDP (formerly the Carbon\nDisclosure Project), Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), the Global Reporting Initiative\n(GRI), the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), and the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), with the Task Force’s recommended disclosures. The Task Force expects\npreparers disclosing climate-related information under other regimes will be able to use existing\nprocesses and content when developing disclosures based on the Task Force’s recommendations.\nThe Task Force’s recommendations provide a common set of principles that should help existing\ndisclosure regimes come into closer alignment over time. Preparers, users, and other\nA stakeholders share a common interest in encouraging such alignment as it relieves a burden for\nIntroduction reporting entities, reduces fragmented disclosure, and provides greater comparability for users.\nThe Task Force also encourages standard setting bodies to support adoption of the\nB\nrecommendations and alignment with the recommended disclosures.\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\n2. Location of Disclosures and Materiality\nC\nRecommendations and In considering possible reporting venues, the Task Force reviewed existing regimes for climate-\nGuidance\nrelated disclosures across G20 countries. While many G20 countries have rules or regulatory\nguidance that require climate-related disclosure for organizations, most are not explicitly focused\nD\nScenario Analysis and on climate-related financial information.50 In addition, the locations of these disclosures vary\nClimate-Related Issues significantly and range from surveys sent to regulators to sustainability reports to annual financial\nfilings (see Appendix 4).\nE\nKey Issues Considered\nand Areas for Further The Task Force also reviewed financial filing requirements applicable to public companies across\nWork G20 countries and found that in most G20 countries, issuers have a legal obligation to disclose\nmaterial information in their financial reports—which includes material, climate-related\nF\ninformation. Such reporting may take the form of a general disclosure of material information,\nConclusion\nbut many jurisdictions require disclosure of material information in specific sections of the\nAppendices financial filing (e.g., in a discussion on risk factors).51\nBased on its review, the Task Force determined that preparers of climate-related financial\ndisclosures should provide such disclosures in their mainstream (i.e., public) annual financial\nfilings.52 The Task Force believes publication of climate-related financial information in\nmainstream financial filings will foster broader utilization of such disclosures, promoting an\ninformed understanding of climate-related issues by investors and others, and support\nshareholder engagement. Importantly, in determining whether information is material, the Task\nForce believes organizations should determine materiality for climate-related issues consistent\nwith how they determine the materiality of other information included in their financial filings. In\naddition, the Task Force cautions organizations against prematurely concluding that climate-\n50 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and CDSB, Climate Change Disclosure in G20 Countries: Stocktaking of\nCorporate Reporting Schemes, November 18, 2015.\n51 N.

The Task Force recognizes organizations’ concerns about disclosing information in\nannual financial filings that is not clearly tied to an assessment of materiality. However, the Task\nForce believes disclosures related to the Governance and Risk Management recommendations\nshould be provided in annual financial filings. Because climate-related risk is a non-diversifiable\nrisk that affects nearly all sectors, many investors believe it requires special attention. For\nexample, in assessing organizations’ financial and operating results, many investors want insight\ninto the governance and risk management context in which such results are achieved. The Task\nForce believes disclosures related to its Governance and Risk Management recommendations\ndirectly address this need for context and\nshould be included in annual financial filings.

Scenario Analysis\nAs part of the Task Force’s second public consultation, many organizations said scenario analysis\nis a useful tool to help assess risks and understand potential implications of climate change;\nhowever, they also identified areas where the Task Force’s recommendations and guidance could\nbe improved. In particular, organizations asked the Task Force to identify standardized climate-\nrelated scenarios for organizations to use and clarify the information related to scenarios that\nshould be disclosed. They also noted expectations around disclosures and climate-related\nscenario analysis should be proportionate to the size of the reporting entity and not onerous for\nsmaller organizations. In addition, some organizations noted that the disclosures related to\nstrategy could put organizations at greater risk of litigation given the high degree of uncertainty\naround the future timing and magnitude of climate-related impacts.\nIn finalizing its recommendations and guidance, the Task Force clarified organizations should\ndescribe how resilient their strategies are to climate-related risks and opportunities, taking into\nconsideration a transition to a lower-carbon economy consistent with a 2°C or lower scenario\nand, where relevant, scenarios consistent with more extreme physical risks. To address concerns\nabout proportionality, the Task Force established a threshold for organizations in the four non-\nA\nfinancial groups that should perform more robust scenario analysis and disclose additional\nIntroduction\ninformation on the resiliency of their strategies.\nB\nOn the issue of recommending specific standardized or reference climate-related scenarios for\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and organizations to use, Task Force members agreed that while such an approach is intuitively\nFinancial Impacts\nappealing, it is not a practical solution at this time. Existing, publicly available climate-related\nscenarios are not structured or defined in such a way that they can be easily applied consistently\nC\nRecommendations and across different industries or across organizations within an industry.\nGuidance\nThe Task Force recognizes that incorporating scenario analysis into strategic planning processes\nD\nwill improve over time as organizations “learn by doing.” To facilitate progress in this area, the\nScenario Analysis and\nTask Force encourages further work as follows:\nClimate-Related Issues\nE  further developing 2°C or lower transition scenarios that can be applied to specific industries\nKey Issues Considered and geographies along with supporting outputs, tools, and user interfaces;\nand Areas for Further\nWork  developing broadly accepted methodologies, data sets, and tools for scenario-based\nevaluation of physical risk by organizations;\nF\nConclusion  making these data sets and tools publicly available to facilitate use by organizations, reduce\norganizational transaction costs, minimize gaps between jurisdictions in terms of technical\nAppendices\nexpertise, enhance comparability of climate-related risk assessments by organizations, and\nhelp ensure comparability for investors; and\n creating more industry specific (financial and non-financial) guidance for preparers and users\nof climate-related scenarios.\n4. Data Availability and Quality and Financial Impact\nThe Task Force developed supplemental guidance for the four non-financial groups that account\nfor the largest proportion of GHG emissions, energy usage, and water usage; and, as part of that\nsupplemental guidance, the Task Force included several illustrative metrics around factors that\nmay be indicative of potential financial implications for climate-related risks and opportunities. As\npart of the second public consultation, several organizations provided feedback on the illustrative\nmetrics, and common themes included (1) improving the comparability and consistency of the\nmetrics, (2) clarifying the links among the metrics, climate-related risks and opportunities, and\npotential financial implications, (3) simplifying the metrics, and (4) providing additional guidance\non the metrics, including how to calculate key metrics. Organizations also raised concerns about\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 35\n\nthe lack of standardized data and metrics in the financial sector, which complicates preparers’\nability to develop decision-useful metrics and users’ ability to compare metrics across\norganizations.\nThe Task Force recognizes these concerns as well as broader challenges related to data\navailability and quality, as described below.\n The gaps in emissions measurement methodologies, including Scope 3 emissions and\nproduct life-cycle emissions methodologies, make reliable and accurate estimates difficult. 55,56\n The lack of robust and cost-effective tools to quantify the potential impact of climate-related\nrisks and opportunities at the asset and project level makes aggregation across an\norganization’s activities or investment portfolios problematic and costly.\n The need to consider the variability of climate-related impacts across and within different\nsectors and markets further complicates the process (and magnifies the cost) of assessing\npotential climate-related financial impacts.\n The high degree of uncertainty around the timing and magnitude of climate-related risks\nA makes it difficult to determine and disclose the potential impacts with precision.\nIntroduction\nIn finalizing its supplemental guidance, the Task Force addressed the redundancy of the metrics;\nB\nsimplified the non-financial illustrative metrics tables; ensured consistent terminology was used;\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and and clarified the links between the metrics, climate-related risks and opportunities, and potential\nFinancial Impacts financial implications. In addition, the Task Force encourages further research and analysis by\nsector and industry experts to (1) better understand and measure how climate-related issues\nC\ntranslate into potential financial impacts; (2) develop standardized metrics for the financial sector,\nRecommendations and\nGuidance including better defining carbon-related assets; and (3) increase organizations’ understanding of\nclimate-related risks and opportunities. As it relates to the broader challenges with data quality\nD\nand availability, the Task Force encourages preparers to include in their disclosures a description\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues of gaps, limitations, and assumptions made as part of their assessment of climate-related issues.\nE\nKey Issues Considered\n5. GHG Emissions Associated with Investments\nand Areas for Further\nWork In its supplemental guidance for asset owners and asset managers issued on December 14, 2016,\nthe Task Force asked such organizations to provide GHG emissions associated with each fund,\nF\nproduct, or investment strategy normalized for every million of the reporting currency invested.\nConclusion\nAs part of the Task Force’s public consultation as well as in discussions with preparers, some asset\nAppendices owners and asset managers expressed concern about reporting on GHG emissions related to\ntheir own or their clients’ investments given the current data challenges and existing accounting\nguidance on how to measure and report GHG emissions associated with investments. In\nparticular, they voiced concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the reported data and\nlimited application of the metric to asset classes beyond public equities. Organizations also\nhighlighted that GHG emissions associated with investments cannot be used as a sole indicator\nfor investment decisions (i.e., additional metrics are needed) and that the metric can fluctuate\nwith share price movements since it uses investors’ proportional share of total equity.57\nIn consideration of the feedback received, the Task Force has replaced the GHG emissions\nassociated with investments metric in the supplemental guidance for asset owners and asset\nmanagers with a weighted average carbon intensity metric. The Task Force believes the weighted\n55 Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and\ndownstream emissions. See Greenhouse Gas Protocol, “Calculation Tools, FAQ.”\n56 Product life cycle emissions are all the emissions associated with the production and use of a specific product, including emissions from raw\nmaterials, manufacture, transport, storage, sale, use, and disposal. See Greenhouse Gas Protocol, “Calculation Tools, FAQ.”\n57 Because the metric uses investors’ proportional share of total equity, increases in the underlying companies’ share prices, all else equal, will\nresult in a decrease in the carbon footprinting number even though GHG emissions are unchanged.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 36\n\naverage carbon intensity metric, which measures exposure to carbon-intensive companies,\naddresses many of the concerns raised. For example, the metric can be applied across asset\nclasses, is fairly simple to calculate, and does not use investors’ proportional share of total equity\nand, therefore, is not sensitive to share price movements.\nThe Task Force acknowledges the challenges and limitations of current carbon footprinting\nmetrics, including that such metrics should not necessarily be interpreted as risk metrics.\nNevertheless, the Task Force views the reporting of weighted average carbon intensity as a first\nstep and expects disclosure of this information to prompt important advancements in the\ndevelopment of decision-useful, climate-related risk metrics. In this regard, the Task Force\nencourages asset owners and asset managers to provide other metrics they believe are useful for\ndecision making along with a description of the methodology used. The Task Force recognizes\nthat some asset owners and asset managers may be able to report the weighted average carbon\nintensity and other metrics on only a portion of their investments given data availability and\nmethodological issues. Nonetheless, increasing the number of organizations reporting this type of\ninformation should help speed the development of better climate-related risk metrics.\nA\nIntroduction 6. Remuneration\nIn the supplemental guidance for the Energy Group, the Task Force asked such organizations to\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, consider disclosing whether and how performance metrics, including links to remuneration\nOpportunities, and policies, take into consideration climate-related risks and opportunities. As part of its second\nFinancial Impacts\npublic consultation, the Task Force asked whether the guidance should extend to organizations\nC beyond those in the Energy group and, if so, to which types of organizations. The majority of\nRecommendations and organizations that commented on this issue responded that the guidance should be extended to\nGuidance\nother organizations; and many suggested that the guidance should apply to organizations more\nlikely to be affected by climate-related risks. In consideration of the feedback received, the Task\nD\nScenario Analysis and Force revised its guidance to ask organizations, where climate-related risks are material, to\nClimate-Related Issues consider describing whether and how related performance metrics are incorporated into\nremuneration policies.\nE\nKey Issues Considered\nand Areas for Further\nWork 7. Accounting Considerations\nF As part of its work, the Task Force considered the interconnectivity of its recommendations with\nConclusion existing financial statement and disclosure requirements. The Task Force determined that the two\nprimary accounting standard setting bodies, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)\nAppendices\nand the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), have issued standards to address risks and\nuncertainties affecting companies. Both International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37 “Provisions,\nContingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” and Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450\n“Contingencies” provide guidance on how to account for and disclose contingencies. Additionally,\nIAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” and ASC 360 “Long-lived Asset Impairment” provide guidance on\nassessing the impairment of long-lived assets. The disclosures of both contingencies and\nmanagement’s assessment and evaluation of long-lived assets for potential impairment are\ncritically important in assisting stakeholders in understanding an organization’s ability to meet\nfuture reported earnings and cash flow goals.\nIn most G20 countries, financial executives will likely recognize that the Task Force’s disclosure\nrecommendations should result in more quantitative financial disclosures, particularly disclosure\nof metrics, about the financial impact that climate-related risks have or could have on an\norganization. Specifically, asset impairments may result from assets adversely impacted by the\neffects of climate change and/or additional liabilities may need to be recorded to account for\nregulatory fines and penalties resulting from enhanced regulatory standards. Additionally, cash\nflows from operations, net income, and access to capital could all be impacted by the effects of\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 37\n\nclimate-related risks (and opportunities). Therefore, financial executives (e.g., chief financial\nofficers, chief accounting officers, and controllers) should be involved in the organization’s\nevaluation of climate-related risks and opportunities and the efforts undertaken to manage the\nrisks and maximize the opportunities. Finally, careful consideration should be given to the linkage\nbetween scenario analyses performed to assess the resilience of an organization’s strategy to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities (as suggested in the Task Force’s recommendations) and\nassumptions underlying cash flow analyses used to assess asset (e.g., goodwill, intangibles, and\nfixed assets) impairments.\n8. Time Frames for Short, Medium, and Long Term\nAs part of the Task Force’s second public consultation, some organizations asked the Task Force\nto define specific ranges for short, medium, and long term. Because the timing of climate-related\nimpacts on organizations will vary, the Task Force believes specifying time frames across sectors\nfor short, medium, and long term could hinder organizations’ consideration of climate-related\nrisks and opportunities specific to their businesses. The Task Force is, therefore, not defining time\nframes and encourages preparers to decide how to define their own time frames according to the\nA\nlife of their assets, the profile of the climate-related risks they face, and the sectors and\nIntroduction\ngeographies in which they operate.\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, In assessing climate-related issues, organizations should be sensitive to the time frames used to\nOpportunities, and conduct their assessments. While many organizations conduct operational and financial planning\nFinancial Impacts\nover a 1-2 year time frame and strategic and capital planning over a 2-5 year time frame, climate-\nC related risks may have implications for an organization over a longer period. It is, therefore,\nRecommendations and important for organizations to consider the appropriate time frames when assessing climate-\nGuidance\nrelated risks.\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues 9. Scope of Coverage\nTo promote more informed investing, lending, and insurance underwriting decisions, the Task\nE\nKey Issues Considered Force recommends all financial and non-financial organizations with public debt and/or equity\nand A reas for Further adopt its recommendations.58 Because climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant for\nWork\norganizations across all sectors, the Task Force encourages all organizations to adopt these\nF recommendations. In addition, the Task Force believes that asset managers and asset owners,\nConclusion including public- and private-sector pension plans, endowments, and foundations, should\nimplement its recommendations. The Task Force believes climate-related financial information\nAppendices\nshould be provided to asset managers’ clients and asset owners’ beneficiaries so that they may\nbetter understand the performance of their assets, consider the risks of their investments, and\nmake more informed investment choices.\nConsistent with existing global stewardship frameworks, asset owners should engage with the\norganizations in which they invest to encourage adoption of these recommendations. They\nshould also ask their asset managers to adopt these recommendations. Asset owners’\nexpectations in relation to climate-related risk reporting from organizations and asset managers\nare likely to evolve as data availability and quality improves, understanding of climate-related risk\nincreases, and risk measurement methodologies are further developed.\nThe Task Force recognizes that several asset owners expressed concern about being identified as\nthe potential “policing body” charged with ensuring adoption of the Task Force’s\nrecommendations by asset managers and underlying organizations. The Task Force appreciates\nthat expectations must be reasonable and that asset owners have many competing priorities, but\n58 Thresholds for climate-related financial disclosures should be aligned to the financial disclosure requirements more broadly in the\njurisdictions where a preparer is incorporated and/or operates and is required to make financial disclosures.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 38\n\nencourages them to help drive adoption of the recommendations. Because asset owners and\nasset managers sit at the top of the investment chain, they have an important role to play in\ninfluencing the organizations in which they invest to provide better climate-related financial\ndisclosures.\n10. Organizational Ownership\nSome organizations have not formalized responsibility for climate-related risk assessment and\nmanagement. Even for organizations with clearly assigned responsibilities for climate-related\nissues, the relationship between those responsible for climate-related risk (e.g., “environmental,\nsocial and governance” experts, chief investment officers) and those in the finance function can\nrange from regularly scheduled interactions and exchanges of information to minimal or no\ninteraction. According to some preparers, lack of clarity around responsibility for climate-related\nrisk assessments and management, compounded by a lack of integration into organizations’\nfinancial reporting processes, could adversely affect implementation of the recommendations.\nThe Task Force believes that by encouraging disclosure of climate-related financial information in\nA public financial filings, coordination between organizations’ climate-related risk experts and the\nIntroduction\nfinance function will improve. Similar to the way organizations are evolving to include cyber\nsecurity issues in their strategic and financial planning efforts, so too should they evolve for\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, climate-related issues.\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\nC\nRecommendations and\nGuidance\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues\nE\nKey Issues Considered\nand Areas for Further\nWork\nF\nConclusion\nAppendices\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 39\n\nF Conclusion\nA\nIntroduction\nB\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\nC\nRecommendations and\nGuidance\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues\nE\nKey Issues Considered and\nAreas for Further Work\nF\nConclusion\nAppendices\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 40\n\nF Conclusion\nFigure 11\nThe Task Force’s recommendations are a Benefits of Recommendations\nfoundation for improved reporting of\n Foundation for immediate adoption and flexible\nclimate-related issues in mainstream\nenough to accommodate evolving practices\nfinancial filings with several resulting\nbenefits (outlined in Figure 11).

Evolution of Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\nIntroduction\nThe Task Force recognizes that challenges exist, but all types of organizations can develop\nB\ndisclosures consistent with its recommendations. The recommendations provide a foundation for\nClimate-Related Risks,\nimmediate adoption and are flexible enough to accommodate evolving practices. As\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts understanding, data analytics, and modeling of climate-related issues become more widespread,\ndisclosures can mature accordingly.\nC\nRecommendations and\nOrganizations already reporting climate-related financial information under other frameworks\nGuidance\nmay be well positioned to disclose under this framework immediately and are encouraged to do\nD so. For such organizations, significant effort has gone into developing processes and collecting\nScenario Analysis and information needed for disclosing under these regimes. The Task Force expects these\nClimate-Related Issues\norganizations will be able to use existing processes when providing disclosures in annual financial\nE filings based on the Task Force’s recommendations.59,60 Those with less experience can begin by\nKey Issues Considered and considering and disclosing how climate-related issues may be relevant in their current\nAreas for Further Work\ngovernance, strategy, and risk management practices. This initial level of disclosure will allow\ninvestors to review, recognize, and understand how organizations consider climate-related issues\nF\nConclusion and their potential financial impact.\nAppendices Importantly, the Task Force recognizes organizations need to make financial disclosures in\naccordance with their national disclosure requirements. To the extent certain elements of the\nrecommendations are incompatible with national disclosure requirements for financial filings, the\nTask Force encourages organizations to disclose those elements through other reports. Such\nother reports should be official company reports that are issued at least annually, widely\ndistributed and available to investors and others, and subject to internal governance processes\nthat are the same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting.\n2. Widespread Adoption Critical\nIn the Task Force’s view, the success of its recommendations depends on near-term, widespread\nadoption by organizations in the financial and non-financial sectors. Through widespread\nadoption, financial risks and opportunities related to climate change will become a natural part of\n59 The Task Force recognizes the structure and content of financial filings differs across jurisdictions and, therefore, believes organizations are\nin the best position to determine where and how the recommended disclosures should be incorporated in financial filings.\n60 The Task Force encourages organizations where climate-related issues could be material in the future to begin disclosing climate-related\nfinancial information outside financial filings to facilitate the incorporation of such information into financial filings once climate-related\nissues are determined to be material.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 41\n\norganizations’ risk management and strategic planning processes. As this occurs, organizations’\nand investors’ understanding of the potential financial implications associated with transitioning\nto a lower-carbon economy and physical risks will grow, information will become more decision-\nuseful, and risks and opportunities will be more accurately priced, allowing for the more efficient\nallocation of capital. Figure 12 outlines a possible path for implementation.\nWidespread adoption of the recommendations will require ongoing leadership by the G20 and its\nmember countries. Such leadership is essential to continue to make the link between these\nrecommendations and the achievements of global climate objectives. Leadership from the FSB is\nalso critical to underscore the importance of better climate-related financial disclosures for the\nfunctioning of the financial system.\nFigure 12\nImplementation Path (Illustrative)\nBroad understanding of the concentration of\ncarbon-related assets in the financial system and\nthe financial system’s exposure to climate-related\nA\nrisks\nIntroduction\nB\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\nGreater adoption, further development of\ninformation provided (e.g., metrics and\nC scenario analysis), and greater maturity in\nRecommendations and\ne\nusing information More complete, consistent, and\nGuidance m comparable information for market\nu\nlo participants, increased transparency,\nD V\nn\nand appropriate pricing of climate-\nScenario Analysis and o related risks and opportunities\nClimate-Related Issues\nitp\no\nd\nA\nE\nKey Issues Considered and Organizations begin to Climate-related issues viewed as\nAreas for Further Work disclose in financial filings mainstream business and investment\nconsiderations by both users and\nF preparers\nConclusion Final TCFD\nReport Released\nCompanies already reporting under other frameworks implement the Task\nAppendices\nForce’s recommendations.

To this end, the Task Force notes that strong support by the FSB and G20\nauthorities would have a positive impact on implementation. With the FSB’s extension of the Task\nForce through September 2018, the Task Force will work to encourage adoption of the\nrecommendations and support the FSB and G20 authorities in promoting the advancement of\nclimate-related financial disclosures.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 42\n\nTCFD Report – DRAFT as of May 27, 2017\nAppendices\nA\nIntroduction\nB\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\nC\nRecommendations and\nGuidance\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues\nE\nKey Issues Considered and\nAreas for Further Work\nF\nConclusion\nAppendices\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures xliii\n\nAppendix 1: Task Force Members\nChairman and Vice Chairs\nMichael Bloomberg\nChair\nFounder\nBloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies\nDenise Pavarina Graeme Pitkethly\nVice Chair Vice Chair\nExecutive Director Chief Financial Officer\nBanco Bradesco Unilever\nChristian Thimann Yeo Lian Sim\nVice Chair Vice Chair\nGroup Head of Regulation, Sustainability, and Special Adviser, Diversity\nInsurance Foresight Singapore Exchange\nA\nAXA\nIntroduction\nB\nMembers\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\nJane Ambachtsheer Matt Arnold\nFinancial Impacts\nPartner, Chair – Responsible Investment Managing Director and Global Head of Sustainable\nC Mercer Finance\nRecommendations and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nGuidance\nWim Bartels Bruno Bertocci\nD Partner Corporate Reporting Managing Director, Head of Sustainable Investors\nScenario Analysis and KPMG UBS Asset Management\nClimate-Related Issues\nDavid Blood Richard Cantor\nE Senior Partner Chief Risk Officer, Moody’s Corporation\nKey Issues Considered and Generation Investment Management Chief Credit Officer, Moody’s Investor Service\nAreas for Further Work\nKoushik Chatterjee Eric Dugelay\nF Group Executive Director, Finance and Corporate Global Leader, Sustainability Services\nConclusion Tata Group Deloitte\nLiliana Franco Udo Hartmann\nAppendices\nDirector, Accounting Organization and Methods Senior Manager, Group Environmental Protection\nAir Liquide Group & Energy Management\nDaimler\nNeil Hawkins Thomas Kusterer\nCorporate Vice President and Chief Sustainability Chief Financial Officer\nOfficer EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG\nThe Dow Chemical Company\nDiane Larsen Stephanie Leaist\nAudit Partner, Global Professional Practice Managing Director, Head of Sustainable Investing\nEY Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\nMark Lewis Eloy Lindeijer\nManaging Director, Head of European Utilities Chief, Investment Management, member\nEquity Research Executive Committee\nBarclays PGGM\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 44\n\nMembers (continued)\nRuixia Liu Masaaki Nagamura\nGeneral Manager, Risk Department Head, Corporate Social Responsibility\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China Tokio Marine Holdings\nGiuseppe Ricci Martin Skancke\nChief Refining and Marketing Officer Chair, Risk Committee\nENI Storebrand\nAndreas Spiegel Steve Waygood\nHead Group Sustainability Risk Chief Responsible Investment Officer\nSwiss Re Aviva Investors\nFiona Wild Michael Wilkins\nVice President, Sustainability and Climate Change Managing Director, Environmental & Climate Risk\nBHP Billiton Research\nS&P Global Ratings\nJon Williams Deborah Winshel\nA Partner, Sustainability and Climate Change Managing Director, Global Head of Impact\nIntroduction PwC Investing\nBlackRock\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, Special Adviser\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\nRussell Picot\nC Chair, Audit and Risk Committee, LifeSight\nRecommendations and Board Chair, HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme\nGuidance Trustee\nFormer Group Chief Accounting Officer, HSBC\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nSecretariat\nClimate-Related Issues\nE Mary Schapiro\nKey Issues Considered a nd Special Advisor to the Chair\nAreas for Further Work\nFormer Chair, U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission\nF\nConclusion Curtis Ravenel Didem Nisanci\nGlobal Head, Sustainable Business & Finance Managing Director\nAppendices\nBloomberg LP Promontory Financial Group, an IBM Company\nStacy Coleman Jeff Stehm\nManaging Director Director\nPromontory Financial Group, an IBM Company Promontory Financial Group, an IBM Company\nMara Childress Veronika Henze\nPrincipal Head of Communications\nPromontory Financial Group, an IBM Company Bloomberg New Energy Finance\nObservers\nSusan Nash Joe Perry\nMember of Secretariat Member of Secretariat\nFinancial Stability Board Financial Stability Board\nRupert Thorne\nDeputy to the Secretary General\nFinancial Stability Board\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 45\n\nAppendix 2: Task Force Objectives and Approach\n1. Objectives\nThe Task Force engaged with key stakeholders throughout the development of its\nrecommendations to ensure that its work would (1) promote alignment across existing disclosure\nregimes, (2) consider the perspectives of users and the concerns of preparers of climate-related\nfinancial disclosures, and (3) be efficiently implemented by organizations in their financial\nreporting.\n2. Approach\nIn addition to the expertise of its members, a broad range of external resources informed the\nTask Force’s recommendations, including existing voluntary and mandatory climate-related\nreporting frameworks, governance and risk management standards, government reports and\nresearch, expert resources, and various other stakeholders such as industry participants, trade\nA associations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nIntroduction\na. Leveraging Expertise\nB\nTask Force members come from a range of companies, including large financial companies, large\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and non-financial companies, accounting and consulting firms, and credit rating agencies, and\nFinancial Impacts brought a range of practical experience, expertise, and global perspectives on preparing and\nusing climate-related financial disclosures. Through eight plenary meetings, Task Force members\nC\nRecommendations and contributed significantly to developing a consensus-based, industry-led approach to climate-\nGuidance related financial disclosure.\nD Due to the technically challenging and broad focus of its work, the Task Force also sought input\nScenario Analysis and\nfrom experts in the field of climate change, particularly in relation to scenario analysis. The Task\nClimate-Related Issues\nForce engaged Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to inform its work by developing a\nE technical paper on scenario analysis—The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-\nKey Issues Considered a nd Related Risks and Opportunities. Several members of the Task Force, joined by representatives\nAreas for Further Work\nfrom 2° Investing Initiative (2°ii), Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), Bloomberg Quantitative\nF Risk Experts, Carbon Tracker, CDP, and the London School of Economics and Political Science led\nConclusion a working group to oversee ERM’s technical considerations. A workshop was also held with\nexperts from Oxford Martin School. Additionally, the International Energy Agency (IEA) provided\nAppendices\ninput regarding how scenario analysis can be conducted and used.\nb. Research and Information Gathering\nThe Task Force’s work drew on publications and research conducted by governments, NGOs,\nindustry participants, as well as disclosure regimes with a focus on climate-related issues. The\nTask Force reviewed existing mandatory and voluntary reporting regimes for climate-related\ndisclosure to identify commonalities and gaps across existing regimes and to determine areas\nmeriting further research and analysis by the Task Force. The work of organizations regarded as\nstandard setters, as well as several organizations active in developing reporting mechanisms for\nclimate-related issues, served as the primary references for the Task Force in developing its\nrecommendations and supporting guidance. The Task Force also considered resources related to\nsector-specific climate issues in the development of the supplemental guidance.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 46\n\nc. Outreach and Engagement\nEngagement with users, preparers, and other stakeholders in relevant industries and sectors\nacross G20 countries and other countries was important in developing the Task Force’s\nrecommendations. The Task Force conducted five types of engagement to support this effort:\npublic consultation, industry interviews, focus groups, outreach events, and webinars.\nSuch engagement served two primary purposes: (1) to raise the level of awareness and educate\nstakeholders on the Task Force’s work and (2) to solicit feedback from stakeholders on the Task\nForce’s proposed recommended disclosures and supplemental guidance for specific sectors. In\ntotal, more than 2,700 individuals in 43 countries were included in the Task Force’s outreach and\nengagement (Figure A2.1).\nPublic Consultations\nThe Task Force conducted two public consultations. The first followed the April 1, 2016 publication\nof the Task Force’s Phase I Report, which set out the scope and high-level objectives for the Task\nForce’s work. The Task Force solicited input to guide the development of its recommendations for\nvoluntary climate-related financial disclosures.

Industry interview participants included chief financial\nofficers, investment officers, other finance and accounting officers, risk officers, sustainability\nE\nofficers, and others. Forty-three percent of the participants held finance, legal, or risk positions\nKey Issues Considered and\nand 39 percent held environmental or sustainability roles.\nAreas for Further Work\nF Task Force representatives conducted two rounds of industry interviews. The initial round of\nConclusion interviews focused on the recommendations and guidance; the second round emphasized\nspecific recommendations and sector-specific guidance. Organizations invited to participate in the\nAppendices\ninterviews met two primary criteria: (1) represented industry and sector leaders likely to be\nimpacted by climate-related risks and opportunities and (2) provided geographic diversity to\nensure coverage from each G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) represented country.\nThe interviews provided valuable information that informed the Task Force’s recommendations\nand guidance as reflected in the report issued for public consultation in December 2016. Industry\ninterview themes were consistent with those identified in the second public consultation.\nPreparers raised concerns about the relationship of the Task Force’s recommendations to other\nreporting initiatives and the accuracy and reliability of information requested. Users commented\nthat establishing consistency in metrics would be beneficial, acknowledged data quality\nchallenges, and provided thoughts on scenario analysis (e.g., would like preparers to use of a\nrange of scenarios, interested in knowing how scenario analysis is used in the organization).\nSubsequent to the December 2016 release of the Task Force’s report for public consultation, the\nTask Force conducted five focus groups with 32 individuals from six countries representing\norganizations in specific sectors and industries to solicit feedback on scenario analysis and carbon\nfootprinting metrics. In the two focus groups for the financial sector, participants expressed\nsupport for the Task Force’s work, noting current challenges related to quality and consistency in\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 49\n\nreported climate-related information. Asset owners and asset managers also provided feedback\non the benefits and limitations of different carbon footprinting metrics. In the three focus groups\nfor non-financial sectors, participants in oil and gas and utilities industries provided specific\nfeedback on their use of scenario analysis and challenges related to disclosing certain information\nin financial filings.\nOutreach Events\nThe Task Force sponsored 18 public outreach events in 13 countries, and Task Force members\npresented the recommendations at 91 other events including conferences, forums, and meetings\nsponsored by industry associations, NGOs, government agencies, corporations, and other\norganizations. The 18 Task Force-sponsored events informed stakeholders of the Task Force’s\nwork and recommendations and included panel discussions and keynote speeches by prominent\nclimate-risk and financial experts. Attendees included representatives of financial and non-\nfinancial organizations who spanned a variety of corporate functions, including strategy, risk,\naccounting, portfolio and investment management, corporate sustainability, as well as\nrepresentatives from industry associations, NGOs, government agencies, research providers,\nacademia, accounting and consulting firms, and media.\nA\nWebinars\nIntroduction\nPrior to the release of the report in December 2016 for public consultation, the Task Force offered\nB seven webinars to educate and increase awareness of the Task Force’s efforts as well as to collect\nClimate-Related Risks,\nadditional feedback. Of the seven webinars, the Task Force hosted four webinars and participated\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts in three additional webinars by partnering with the following organizations: Business for Social\nResponsibility, Global Financial Markets Association, and the National Association of Corporate\nC Directors. These webinars served to supplement the in-person outreach events and offered\nRecommendations and\nglobal stakeholders, regardless of location, an opportunity to engage with the Task Force. The\nGuidance\nwebinars included 538 attendees representing 365 organizations across 23 countries. After the\nD release of the report, the Task Force held three webinars to present its recommendations and to\nScenario Analysis and solicit additional feedback. The three webinars included 255 attendees representing 209\nClimate-Related Issues\norganizations across 25 countries. In total, the Task Force offered ten webinars, reaching 793\nE attendees across 30 countries.\nKey Issues Considered and\nAreas for Further Work\nF\nConclusion\nAppendices\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 50\n\nAppendix 3: Fundamental Principles for Effective Disclosure\nTo underpin its recommendations and help guide current and future developments in climate-\nrelated financial reporting, the Task Force developed a set of principles for effective\ndisclosure.63 As understanding of, and approaches to, climate-related issues evolve over time,\nso too will climate-related financial reporting. These principles can help achieve high-quality\nand decision-useful disclosures that enable users to understand the impact of climate change\non organizations. The Task Force encourages organizations adopting its recommendations to\nconsider these principles as they develop climate-related financial disclosures.\nThe Task Force’s disclosure principles are largely consistent with other mainstream,\ninternationally accepted frameworks for financial reporting and are generally applicable to\nmost providers of financial disclosures. They are informed by the qualitative and quantitative\ncharacteristics of financial information and further the overall goals of producing disclosures\nthat are consistent, comparable, reliable, clear, and efficient, as highlighted by the FSB in\nestablishing the Task Force. The principles, taken together, are designed to assist\norganizations in making clear the linkages and connections between climate-related issues\nA\nIntroduction and their governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\nB Principle 1: Disclosures should present relevant information\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and The organization should provide information specific to the potential impact of climate-related\nFinancial Impacts\nrisks and opportunities on its markets, businesses, corporate or investment strategy, financial\nstatements, and future cash flows.\nC\nRecommendations and\n Disclosures should be eliminated if they are immaterial or redundant to avoid obscuring\nGuidance\nrelevant information. However, when a particular risk or issue attracts investor and\nD market interest or attention, it may be helpful for the organization to include a\nScenario Analysis and statement that the risk or issue is not significant. This shows that the risk or issue has\nClimate-Related Issues\nbeen considered and has not been overlooked.\nE\n Disclosures should be presented in sufficient detail to enable users to assess the\nKey Issues Considered and\norganization’s exposure and approach to addressing climate-related issues, while\nAreas for Further Work\nunderstanding that the type of information, the way in which it is presented, and the\nF accompanying notes will differ between organizations and will be subject to change over\nConclusion\ntime.\nAppendices  Climate-related impacts can occur over the short, medium, and long term. Organizations\ncan experience chronic, gradual impacts (such as impacts due to shifting temperature\npatterns), as well as acute, abrupt disruptive impacts (such as impacts from flooding,\ndrought, or sudden regulatory actions). An organization should provide information\nfrom the perspective of the potential impact of climate-related issues on value creation,\ntaking into account and addressing the different time frames and types of impacts.\n Organizations should avoid generic or boilerplate disclosures that do not add value to\nusers’ understanding of issues. Furthermore, any proposed metrics should adequately\ndescribe or serve as a proxy for risk or performance and reflect how an organization\nmanages the risk and opportunities.\n63 These principles are adapted from those included in the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force’s “Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks.”\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 51\n\nPrinciple 2: Disclosures should be specific and complete\n An organization’s reporting should provide a thorough overview of its exposure to\npotential climate-related impacts; the potential nature and size of such impacts; the\norganization’s governance, strategy, processes for managing climate-related risks, and\nperformance with respect to managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n To be sufficiently comprehensive, disclosures should contain historical and future-\noriented information in order to allow users to evaluate their previous expectations\nrelative to actual performance and assess possible future financial implications.\n For quantitative information, the disclosure should include an explanation of the\ndefinition and scope applied. For future-oriented data, this includes clarification of the\nkey assumptions used. Forward-looking quantitative disclosure should align with data\nused by the organization for investment decision making and risk management.\n Any scenario analyses should be based on data or other information used by the\norganization for investment decision making and risk management. Where appropriate,\nthe organization should also demonstrate the effect on selected risk metrics or\nA exposures to changes in the key underlying methodologies and assumptions, both in\nIntroduction qualitative and quantitative terms.\nB\nPrinciple 3: Disclosures should be clear, balanced, and understandable\nClimate-Related Risks,\nOpportunities, and\n Disclosures should be written with the objective of communicating financial information\nFinancial Impacts\nthat serves the needs of a range of financial sector users (e.g., investors, lenders,\nC insurers, and others). This requires reporting at a level beyond compliance with\nRecommendations and minimum requirements. The disclosures should be sufficiently granular to inform\nGuidance\nsophisticated users, but should also provide concise information for those who are less\nspecialized. Clear communication will allow users to identify key information efficiently.\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues  Disclosures should show an appropriate balance between qualitative and quantitative\ninformation and use text, numbers, and graphical presentations as appropriate.\nE\nKey Issues Considered and  Fair and balanced narrative explanations should provide insight into the meaning of\nAreas for Further Work quantitative disclosures, including the changes or developments they portray over time.\nFurthermore, balanced narrative explanations require that risks as well as opportunities\nF\nbe portrayed in a manner that is free from bias.\nConclusion\n Disclosures should provide straightforward explanations of issues. Terms used in the\nAppendices\ndisclosures should be explained or defined for a proper understanding by the users.\nPrinciple 4: Disclosures should be consistent over time\n Disclosures should be consistent over time to enable users to understand the\ndevelopment and/or evolution of the impact of climate-related issues on the\norganization’s business. Disclosures should be presented using consistent formats,\nlanguage, and metrics from period to period to allow for inter-period comparisons.\nPresenting comparative information is preferred; however, in some situations it may be\npreferable to include a new disclosure even if comparative information cannot be\nprepared or restated.\n Changes in disclosures and related approaches or formats (e.g., due to shifting climate-\nrelated issues and evolution of risk practices, governance, measurement methodologies,\nor accounting practices) can be expected due to the relative immaturity of climate-\nrelated disclosures. Any such changes should be explained.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 52\n\nPrinciple 5: Disclosures should be comparable among organizations within a sector,\nindustry, or portfolio\n Disclosures should allow for meaningful comparisons of strategy, business activities,\nrisks, and performance across organizations and within sectors and jurisdictions.\n The level of detail provided in disclosures should enable comparison and benchmarking\nof risks across sectors and at the portfolio level, where appropriate.\n The placement of reporting would ideally be consistent across organizations—i.e., in\nfinancial filings—in order to facilitate easy access to the relevant information.\nPrinciple 6: Disclosures should be reliable, verifiable, and objective\n Disclosures should provide high-quality reliable information. They should be accurate\nand neutral—i.e., free from bias.\n Future-oriented disclosures will inherently involve the organization’s judgment (which\nshould be adequately explained). To the extent possible, disclosures should be based on\nobjective data and use best-in-class measurement methodologies, which would include\nA common industry practice as it evolves.\nIntroduction\n Disclosures should be defined, collected, recorded, and analyzed in such a way that the\nB\ninformation reported is verifiable to ensure it is high quality. For future-oriented\nClimate-Related Risks,\ninformation, this means assumptions used can be traced back to their sources. This\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts does not imply a requirement for independent external assurance; however, disclosures\nshould be subject to internal governance processes that are the same or substantially\nC\nsimilar to those used for financial reporting.\nRecommendations and\nGuidance\nPrinciple 7: Disclosures should be provided on a timely basis\nD\nScenario Analysis and  Information should be delivered to users or updated in a timely manner using\nClimate-Related Issues appropriate media on, at least, an annual basis within the mainstream financial report.\nE  Climate-related risks can result in disruptive events. In case of such events with a\nKey Issues Considered and material financial impact, the organization should provide a timely update of climate-\nAreas for Further Work\nrelated disclosures as appropriate.\nF Reporters may encounter tension in the application of the fundamental principles set out above.\nConclusion\nFor example, an organization may update a methodology to meet the comparability principle,\nwhich could then result in a conflict with the principle of consistency. Tension can also arise within\nAppendices\na single principle. For example, Principle 6 states that disclosures should be verifiable, but\nassumptions made about future-oriented disclosures often require significant judgment by\nmanagement that is difficult to verify. Such tensions are inevitable given the wide-ranging and\nsometimes competing needs of users and preparers of disclosures. Organizations should aim to\nfind an appropriate balance of disclosures that reasonably satisfy the recommendations and\nprinciples while avoiding overwhelming users with unnecessary information.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 53\n\nAppendix 4: Select Disclosure Frameworks\nTo the extent there is corporate reporting of climate-related issues, it happens through a\nmultitude of mandatory and voluntary schemes. Although a complete and comprehensive survey\nof existing schemes is beyond the scope of this report, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD or Task Force) considered a broad range of existing frameworks, both voluntary\nand mandatory. The tables in Appendix 4 outline select disclosure frameworks considered by the\nTask Force and describe a few key characteristics of each framework, including whether\ndisclosures are mandatory or voluntary, what type of information is reported, who the target\nreporters and target audiences are, where the disclosed information is placed, and whether there\nare specified materiality standards.64 These disclosure frameworks were chosen to illustrate the\nbroad range of disclosure regimes around the world; the tables are broken out into disclosure\nframeworks sponsored by governments, stock exchanges, and non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs).\nThe information presented in the tables below (A4.1, A4.2, and A4.3) is based on information\nreleased by governments, stock exchanges, and standard setters and is supplemented by the\nA\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), “The Financial System We Need: Aligning the\nIntroduction\nFinancial System with Sustainable Development,” October 2015, and the Organization for\nB Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), “Report to G20 Finance Ministers and Central\nClimate-Related Risks, Bank Governors,” September 2015.\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\nC\nRecommendations and\nGuidance\nD\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues\nE\nKey Issues Considered and\nAreas for Further Work\nF\nConclusion\nAppendices\n64 These tables were originally included in the Task Force’s Phase I Report and have been updated where appropriate.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 54\n\nTable A4.1\nSelect Disclosure Frameworks: Governments\nRegion: Target Target Mandatory Materiality Types of Climate- Disclosure External Assurance\nFramework Reporter Audience or Voluntary Standard Related Information Location Required\nAustralia: Financial and General public Mandatory if Based on emissions GHG emissions, Report to Regulator may, by written\nnon-financial thresholds are above a certain energy consumption, government notice to corporation,\nNational Greenhouse\nfirms that meet met threshold and energy production require an audit of its\nand Energy Reporting\nemissions or disclosures\nAct (2007)\nenergy\nproduction or\nconsumption\nthresholds\nEuropean Union (EU): Financial and Investors, Mandatory; None specified Land use, water use, GHG Corporate financial Member States must require\nnon-financial consumers, applicable for emissions, use of report or separate that statutory auditor checks\nEU Directive 2014/95\nfirms that meet and other the financial materials, and energy use report (published whether the non-financial\nregarding disclosure of\nsize criteria stakeholders year starting with financial report statement has been\nnon-financial and\n(i.e., have more on Jan. 1, 2017 or on website six provided\ndiversity information\nthan 500 or during the months after the\n(2014) Member States may require\nemployees) 2017 calendar balance sheet date\nindependent assurance for\nyear and referenced in\ninformation in non-financial\nfinancial report)\nstatement\nFrance: Listed financial Investors, Mandatory None specified Risks related to climate Annual report and Mandatory review on the\nand non- general public change, consequences of website consistency of the disclosure\nArticle 173, Energy\nfinancial firms climate change on the by an independent third\nTransition Law (2015)\ncompany's activities and party, such as a statutory\nAdditional use of goods and services auditor\nrequirements it produces.

Some countries use a two-tiered\nsystem where “board” refers to the “supervisory board” while “key executives” refers to the\n“management board.”65\nCLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITY refers to the potential positive impacts related to climate\nchange on an organization. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce\nopportunities for organizations, such as through resource efficiency and cost savings, the\nadoption and utilization of low-emission energy sources, the development of new products and\nservices, and building resilience along the supply chain. Climate-related opportunities will vary\ndepending on the region, market, and industry in which an organization operates.\nCLIMATE-RELATED RISK refers to the potential negative impacts of climate change on an\norganization. Physical risks emanating from climate change can be event-driven (acute) such as\nA\nincreased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, droughts, floods, and fires). They can\nIntroduction\nalso relate to longer-term shifts (chronic) in precipitation and temperature and increased\nB variability in weather patterns (e.g., sea level rise). Climate-related risks can also be associated\nClimate-Related Risks, with the transition to a lower-carbon global economy, the most common of which relate to policy\nOpportunities, and\nand legal actions, technology changes, market responses, and reputational considerations.\nFinancial Impacts\nC FINANCIAL FILINGS refer to the annual reporting packages in which organizations are required\nRecommendations and to deliver their audited financial results under the corporate, compliance, or securities laws of the\nGuidance\njurisdictions in which they operate. While reporting requirements differ internationally, financial\nfilings generally contain financial statements and other information such as governance\nD\nScenario Analysis and statements and management commentary.66\nClimate-Related Issues\nFINANCIAL PLANNING refers to an organization’s consideration of how it will achieve and fund\nE its objectives and strategic goals. The process of financial planning allows organizations to assess\nKey Issues Considered and\nfuture financial positions and determine how resources can be utilized in pursuit of short- and\nAreas for Further Work\nlong-term objectives. As part of financial planning, organizations often create “financial plans” that\nF outline the specific actions, assets, and resources (including capital) necessary to achieve these\nConclusion\nobjectives over a 1-5 year period. However, financial planning is broader than the development of\na financial plan as it includes long-term capital allocation and other considerations that may\nAppendices\nextend beyond the typical 3-5 year financial plan (e.g., investment, research and development,\nmanufacturing, and markets).\nGOVERNANCE refers to “the system by which an organization is directed and controlled in the\ninterests of shareholders and other stakeholders.”67 “Governance involves a set of relationships\nbetween an organization’s management, its board, its shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nGovernance provides the structure and processes through which the objectives of the\norganization are set, progress against performance is monitored, and results are evaluated.”68\n65 OECD, G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, OECD Publishing, Paris, 2015.\n66 Based on Climate Disclosure Standards Board, “CDSB Framework for Reporting Environmental Information and Natural Capital,” June 2015.\n67 A. Cadbury, Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, London, 1992.\n68 OECD, G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, OECD Publishing, Paris, 2015.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 62\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS SCOPE LEVELS69\n Scope 1 refers to all direct GHG emissions.\n Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or\nsteam.\n Scope 3 refers to other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that occur in the value\nchain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Scope\n3 emissions could include: the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels,\ntransport-related activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity,\nelectricity-related activities (e.g., transmission and distribution losses), outsourced activities,\nand waste disposal. 70\nINTERNAL CARBON PRICE is an internally developed estimated cost of carbon emissions.\nInternal carbon pricing can be used as a planning tool to help identify revenue opportunities and\nrisks, as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs, and to guide capital investment\ndecisions.\nMANAGEMENT refers to those positions an organization views as executive or senior\nA\nmanagement positions and that are generally separate from the board.\nIntroduction\nNATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) refers to the post-2020 actions that a\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, country intends to take under the international climate agreement adopted in Paris.\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts\nORGANIZATION refers to the group, company, or companies, and other entities for which\nconsolidated financial statements are prepared, including subsidiaries and jointly controlled\nC\nRecommendations and entities.\nGuidance\nPUBLICLY AVAILABLE 2°C SCENARIO refers to a 2°C scenario that is (1) used/referenced and\nD\nissued by an independent body; (2) wherever possible, supported by publicly available datasets;\nScenario Analysis and\n(3) updated on a regular basis; and (4) linked to functional tools (e.g., visualizers, calculators, and\nClimate-Related Issues\nmapping tools) that can be applied by organizations. 2°C scenarios that presently meet these\nE criteria include: IEA 2DS, IEA 450, Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, and International\nKey Issues Considered and\nRenewable Energy Agency.\nAreas for Further Work\nRISK MANAGEMENT refers to a set of processes that are carried out by an organization’s board\nF\nConclusion and management to support the achievement of the organization’s objectives by addressing its\nrisks and managing the combined potential impact of those risks.\nAppendices\nSCENARIO ANALYSIS is a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of outcomes of\nfuture events under conditions of uncertainty. In the case of climate change, for example,\nscenarios allow an organization to explore and develop an understanding of how the physical and\ntransition risks of climate change may impact its businesses, strategies, and financial\nperformance over time.\nSECTOR refers to a segment of organizations performing similar business activities in an\neconomy. A sector generally refers to a large segment of the economy or grouping of business\ntypes, while “industry” is used to describe more specific groupings of organizations within a\nsector.\nSTRATEGY refers to an organization’s desired future state. An organization’s strategy establishes\na foundation against which it can monitor and measure its progress in reaching that desired\nstate. Strategy formulation generally involves establishing the purpose and scope of the\n69 World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development, The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and\nReporting Standard (Revised Edition), March 2004.\n70 IPCC, Climate Change 2014 Mitigation of Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, 2014.\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 63\n\norganization’s activities and the nature of its businesses, taking into account the risks and\nopportunities it faces and the environment in which it operates.\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT is an organizational report that gives information about economic,\nenvironmental, social, and governance performance and impacts. For companies and\norganizations, sustainability —the ability to be long-lasting or permanent—is based on\nperformance and impacts in these four key areas.\nVALUE CHAIN refers to the upstream and downstream life cycle of a product, process, or service,\nincluding material sourcing, production, consumption, and disposal/recycling. Upstream activities\ninclude operations that relate to the initial stages of producing a good or service (e.g., material\nsourcing, material processing, supplier activities). Downstream activities include operations that\nrelate to processing the materials into a finished product and delivering it to the end user (e.g.,\ntransportation, distribution, and consumption).\nAbbreviations\n2°C —2° Celsius IEA—International Energy Agency\nA\nIntroduction ASC—Accounting Standards Codification IIGCC—Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change\nBNEF—Bloomberg New Energy Finance IIRC—International Integrated Reporting Council\nB\nClimate-Related Risks, CDSB—Climate Disclosure Standards Board IPCC—Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nOpportunities, and\nFinancial Impacts ERM—Environmental Resources Management NGO—Non-governmental organization\nEU—European Union OECD—Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\nC\nRecommendations and FASB—Financial Accounting Standards Board R&D—Research and development\nGuidance\nFSB—Financial Stability Board SASB—Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\nD\nG20—Group of 20 TCFD—Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\nScenario Analysis and\nClimate-Related Issues GHG—Greenhouse gas UN—United Nations\nE GICS—Global Industry Classification Standard UNEP—United Nations Environment Programme\nKey Issues Considered and\nGRI—Global Reporting Initiative USDE—U.S. Dollar Equivalent\nAreas for Further Work\nIAS—International Accounting Standard WRI—World Resources Institute\nF\nIASB—International Accounting Standards Board\nConclusion\nAppendices\nRecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 64\n\nAppendix 6: References\n“Communiqué from the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Washington, D.C.\nApril 16-17, 2015.” April 2015.\nwww.g20.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/April-G20-FMCBG-Communique-Final.pdf.\nCadbury, A.

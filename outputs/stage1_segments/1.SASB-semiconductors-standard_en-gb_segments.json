GHG emissions may create regulatory\ncompliance costs and operating risks for semiconductors entities, although resulting financial effects may vary\ndepending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. Entities that cost-effectively\nmanage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative chemicals or manufacturing process\nadvances may benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk.\nMetrics\nTC-SC-110a.1.

The price of conventional grid electricity and\nvolatility of fossil fuel prices may increase because of evolving climate change regulations and new incentives for\nenergy efficiency and renewable energy, among other factors, while alternative energy sources become more cost-\ncompetitive. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as alternative energy use, may create trade-offs\nrelated to the energy supply’s cost and reliability for operations. As industry innovation adds complexity to\nmanufacturing processes, new technologies to manufacture semiconductors may consume more energy unless\nentities invest in the energy efficiency of their operations. The way an entity manages energy efficiency, reliance on\ndifferent types of energy, the associated sustainability risks, and alternative energy source access may affect financial\nperformance.\nMetrics\nTC-SC-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity and\n(3) percentage renewable\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from\nexternal sources and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage,\npurchased electricity, and heating, cooling and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy\nconsumption.\n1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting\nperiod.\n1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV),\nalso known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are measured directly or taken from the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy\nconsumption.\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that was renewable energy.\n3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to\ntheir rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro and biomass.\n3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | SEMICONDUCTORS|11",

As manufacturing becomes more complex,\nentities in the industry are discovering the importance of reducing ultra-pure water use. Water is becoming a scarce\nresource around the world, because of increasing consumption from population growth and rapid urbanisation, and\nreduced supplies because of climate change. Furthermore, water pollution in developing countries makes available\nwater supplies unusable or expensive to treat. Without careful planning, water scarcity may result in higher supply\ncosts, social tensions with local communities and governments, or loss of water access in water-scarce regions,\nthereby presenting a critical risk to production. Semiconductor entities that increase water use efficiency during\nmanufacturing may maintain a lower risk profile and face reduced regulatory risks as local, regional and national\nenvironmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation.\nMetrics\nTC-SC-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed; percentage of\neach in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic metres, withdrawn from all sources.\n1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes and oceans),\ngroundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from\nmunicipal water supplies, water utilities or other entities.\n2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from\nnon-freshwater sources.\n2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. If no\nlegal definition exists, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million\nof dissolved solids.\n2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be\nassumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n3 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic metres, consumed in its operations.\n3.1 Water consumption is defined as:\n3.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, use and discharge\n3.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity’s product or service\n3.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn,\nsuch as water returned to another catchment area or the sea\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | SEMICONDUCTORS|13",

Other sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use,\nresource scarcity and conflict in regions where the industry’s supply chain operates are also increasingly shaping the\nindustry’s ability to source materials. Additionally, increased competition for these materials because of growing global\ndemand from other sectors may result in price increases and supply risks. The management of potential materials\nshortages, supply disruptions, price volatility and reputational risks is made more difficult by the practice of commonly\nsourcing materials from supply chains that often lack transparency. Failure to effectively manage this issue may\nconstrain access to necessary materials, reduce margins, impair revenue growth or increase costs of capital.\nMetrics\nTC-SC-440a.1. Description of the management of risks associated with the use of\ncritical materials\n1 The entity shall describe how it manages the risks associated with the use of critical materials in its products,\nincluding physical limits on availability and access, changes in price, and regulatory and reputational risks, in\nwhich:\n1.1 a critical material is defined as a material both essential in use and subject to the risk of supply restriction;\nand\n1.2 examples of critical materials may include:\n1.2.1 antimony, cobalt, fluorspar, gallium, germanium, graphite, indium, magnesium, niobium, tantalum\nand tungsten;\n1.2.2 platinum group metals (platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and osmium); and\n1.2.3 rare earth elements, which include yttrium, scandium, lanthanum and the lanthanides (cerium,\npraseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,\nholmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium).\n2 The entity shall identify the critical materials that present a significant risk to its operations, the type of risks they\nrepresent and the strategies the entity uses to mitigate the risks.\n2.1 Relevant strategies may include diversification of suppliers, stockpiling of materials, development or\nprocurement of alternative and substitute materials, and investments in recycling technology for critical\nmaterials.\n3 All disclosure shall be sufficient such that it is specific to the risks the entity faces, but that disclosure itself would\nnot compromise the entity’s ability to maintain confidential information.\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | SEMICONDUCTORS|23",

IP protection can be an important driver of innovation, but some entities\nmay also acquire and enforce patents and other IP protection to restrict competition, particularly if they are dominant\nmarket players. Industry standard-setting can involve complex negotiations over patent rights and licensing terms, and\nentities use cross-licenses and patent pools to address difficulties around patent thickets. However, such industry\ncooperation also may raise antitrust concerns, for example, with provisions in portfolio cross-licenses that could\nenable price fixing. Adverse legal or regulatory rulings related to antitrust and IP may expose software and IT services\nentities to costly and lengthy litigations and potential monetary losses as a result. Such rulings may also affect an\nentity’s market share and pricing power, if its patents or dominant position in important markets are challenged legally,\nwith significant financial consequences. Therefore, entities that balance the IP protection and its use to spur\ninnovation and ensure their IP management and other business practices do not unfairly restrict competition may\nreduce regulatory scrutiny and legal actions while protecting market value.\nMetrics\nTC-SC-520a.1.

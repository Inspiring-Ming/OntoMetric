    "content": "Preface\nIntroduction\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) develops, issues and maintains Australian Sustainability Reporting\nStandards. The AASB is an Australian Government entity under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission\nAct 2001.\nMain features of this Standard\nMain requirements\nAASB S2 Climate-related Disclosures sets out disclosure requirements for an entity to provide useful information to\nprimary users of its general purpose financial report about climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably\nbe expected to affect the entity’s cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term.\nThe main climate-related financial disclosure requirements relate to governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics\nand targets, including information about scenario analysis and Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Standard also includes general requirements for the disclosure of climate-related financial information (see\nAppendix D). The general requirements include the conceptual foundations for reporting such information, the location\nof disclosures, the timing of reporting and disclosures relating to judgements, uncertainties and errors.\nAn entity applying AASB S2 is not required to apply AASB S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information, which is a voluntary Standard addressing sustainability-related financial disclosures in\ngeneral. Appendix D of this Standard contains paragraphs drawn from AASB S1. However, the requirements in\nAppendix D apply only to climate-related financial information, and not to the broader sustainability-related financial\ninformation covered by AASB S1. Nevertheless, an entity may refer to AASB S1 for guidance in complying with the\nrequirements in Appendix D.\nApplication date\nThis Standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Earlier application is permitted.\nThe Corporations Act 2001 sets out which entities are required to comply with this Standard and specifies three\napplication dates (financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025, 1 July 2026 and 1 July 2027) for the various\nclasses of entity.\nAASB S2 4 PREFACE\n\nComparison with IFRS S2\nAustralian Sustainability Reporting Standard AASB S2 Climate-related Disclosures is based on IFRS Sustainability\nDisclosure Standard IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board\n(ISSB). The AASB developed AASB S2 by incorporating the content of IFRS S2, including the IFRS S2 paragraph\nnumbering, modified to the extent necessary to take account of the Australian legal and institutional environment and,\nin particular, to ensure that any disclosure and transparency provisions are appropriate. This includes:\n(a) adding Australian-specific paragraphs (with an “Aus” prefix in the paragraph numbering) relating to the\ncommencement of the legislative instrument, the effective date of AASB S2 and other Australian-specific\nrequirements; and\n(b) modifying certain requirements set out in IFRS S2 by replacing IFRS S2 paragraphs with Australian-specific\nparagraphs (with an “Aus” prefix in the paragraph numbering) in AASB S2. Paragraphs that apply only to\nnot-for-profit entities begin by identifying their limited applicability.\nAASB S2 includes modifications from the requirements set out in IFRS S2, as described below.\n(a) The ISSB developed IFRS S2 to be applied concurrently with IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure\nof Sustainability-related Financial Information. The content of IFRS S1 is incorporated in AASB S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information. AASB S1 is a voluntary\nStandard and therefore:\n(i) an entity applying AASB S2 is not required to apply AASB S1. Rather, an entity applying AASB S2\napplies the requirements set out in Appendix D General requirements for disclosure of climate-\nrelated financial information, which incorporates the content of IFRS S1 the AASB considered\nnecessary to enable AASB S2 to function as the standalone mandatory Standard containing all of\nthe requirements regarding climate-related financial disclosures; and\n(ii) the AASB clarified that the requirements set out in IFRS S2 paragraphs 7 and 26 apply particularly\nif an entity elects to voluntarily apply AASB S1 to disclose information about other sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities in addition to climate-related risks and opportunities. The paragraphs\nrequire an entity to avoid unnecessary duplication of disclosures by providing integrated disclosures\ninstead of separate disclosures for each sustainability-related risk and opportunity, if oversight of\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities is managed on an integrated basis.\n(b) Relevant references to IFRS S1 paragraphs are replaced with references to Appendix D paragraphs. The\nrequirements set out in IFRS S1 paragraphs B6(b) and B11 are consistent with IFRS S2 paragraphs B34 and\nB36; consequently, cross-references to IFRS S1 paragraphs B6(b) and B11 are omitted in AASB S2\nparagraphs B34–B36.\n(c) To comply with IFRS S2, in accordance with IFRS S1 paragraphs 20 and B38, an entity would need to prepare\nclimate-related financial disclosures for its consolidated group if the related financial statements are prepared\nfor that consolidated group. The Corporations Act 2001, as amended by the Treasury Laws Amendment\n(Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Act 2024, does not require a parent entity of a\nconsolidated group to prepare climate-related financial disclosures for its consolidated group. Under section\n292A(2) of the Corporations Act, a parent entity has the choice of preparing a sustainability report for either\nthe consolidated entity or the parent entity. Accordingly, the AASB modified the requirements set out in\nAppendix D based on those IFRS S1 paragraphs to specify that an entity’s climate-related financial disclosures\nshall be for the same reporting entity as the related financial statements unless otherwise permitted by law.\n(d) IFRS S2 paragraphs 12, 23, 28(b), 32, 37, B65(d) and B67 require an entity to disclose industry-based metrics\nand to refer to and consider the applicability of the industry-based disclosure topics (and the industry-based\nmetrics associated with those disclosure topics) defined in the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing\nIFRS S2 issued by the ISSB. The AASB modified or omitted (where relevant) the requirements in those\nIFRS S2 paragraphs so that an entity applying AASB S2 is not required to disclose industry-based metrics or\nto consider those disclosure topics. The AASB also omitted the definition of “disclosure topic” in Appendix A\nDefined terms.\n(e) A not-for-profit entity is required to refer to the descriptions of “general purpose financial reports” and\n“primary users of general purpose financial reports” in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation\nof Financial Statements when applying AASB S2, rather than the definitions of those terms in Appendix A.\n(f) Consistent with the Legislation Act 2003, AASB S2 specifies the relevant versions of non-legislative\nAustralian documents and foreign documents referenced in the Standard, such as the latest international\nagreement on climate change and the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).\nAASB S2 5 COMPARISON",

For the purposes of this Standard, these risks and opportunities are collectively\nreferred to as ‘climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s\nprospects’.\nScope\n3 This Standard applies to:\n(a) climate-related risks to which the entity is exposed, which are:\n(i) climate-related physical risks; and\n(ii) climate-related transition risks; and\n(b) climate-related opportunities available to the entity.\n4 Climate-related risks and opportunities that could not reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s\nprospects are outside the scope of this Standard.\nCore content\nGovernance\n5 The objective of climate-related financial disclosures on governance is to enable users of general\npurpose financial reports to understand the governance processes, controls and procedures an entity\nuses to monitor, manage and oversee climate-related risks and opportunities.\n6 To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:\n(a) the governance body(s) (which can include a board, committee or equivalent body charged with\ngovernance) or individual(s) responsible for oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.\nSpecifically, the entity shall identify that body(s) or individual(s) and disclose information about:\n(i) how responsibilities for climate-related risks and opportunities are reflected in the terms\nof reference, mandates, role descriptions and other related policies applicable to that\nbody(s) or individual(s);\n(ii) how the body(s) or individual(s) determines whether appropriate skills and competencies\nare available or will be developed to oversee strategies designed to respond to climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities;\n1 Throughout this Standard, the terms ‘primary users’ and ‘users’ are used interchangeably, with the same meaning.\nAASB S2 6 STANDARD\n\n(iii) how and how often the body(s) or individual(s) is informed about climate-related risks\nand opportunities;\n(iv) how the body(s) or individual(s) takes into account climate-related risks and opportunities\nwhen overseeing the entity’s strategy, its decisions on major transactions and its risk\nmanagement processes and related policies, including whether the body(s) or\nindividual(s) has considered trade-offs associated with those risks and opportunities; and\n(v) how the body(s) or individual(s) oversees the setting of targets related to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, and monitors progress towards those targets (see paragraphs 33–\n36), including whether and how related performance metrics are included in remuneration\npolicies (see paragraph 29(g)).\n(b) management’s role in the governance processes, controls and procedures used to monitor, manage\nand oversee climate-related risks and opportunities, including information about:\n(i) whether the role is delegated to a specific management-level position or management-\nlevel committee and how oversight is exercised over that position or committee; and\n(ii) whether management uses controls and procedures to support the oversight of climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities and, if so, how these controls and procedures are integrated\nwith other internal functions.\n7 In preparing disclosures to fulfil the requirements in paragraph 6, an entity shall avoid unnecessary duplication\nin accordance with Appendix D (see paragraph B42(b) in Appendix D). For example, although an entity shall\nprovide the information required by paragraph 6, if oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities\nis managed on an integrated basis, the entity would avoid duplication by providing integrated governance\ndisclosures instead of separate disclosures for each sustainability-related risk and opportunity.\nAus7.1 The requirement in paragraph 7 to avoid unnecessary duplication applies particularly if an entity\nelects to voluntarily apply AASB S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related\nFinancial Information (September 2024) to disclose information about other sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities in addition to climate-related risks and opportunities in general purpose\nfinancial reports.\nStrategy\n8 The objective of climate-related financial disclosures on strategy is to enable users of general purpose\nfinancial reports to understand an entity’s strategy for managing climate-related risks and\nopportunities.\n9 Specifically, an entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to\nunderstand:\n(a) the climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s\nprospects (see paragraphs 10–12);\n(b) the current and anticipated effects of those climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s\nbusiness model and value chain (see paragraph 13);\n(c) the effects of those climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s strategy and decision-\nmaking, including information about its climate-related transition plan (see paragraph 14);\n(d) the effects of those climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s financial position,\nfinancial performance and cash flows for the reporting period, and their anticipated effects on the\nentity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium and long\nterm, taking into consideration how those climate-related risks and opportunities have been factored\ninto the entity’s financial planning (see paragraphs 15–21); and\n(e) the climate resilience of the entity’s strategy and its business model to climate-related changes,\ndevelopments and uncertainties, taking into consideration the entity’s identified climate-related\nrisks and opportunities (see paragraph 22).\nClimate-related risks and opportunities\n10 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand the\nclimate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects.\nSpecifically, the entity shall:\n(a) describe climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the\nentity’s prospects;\nAASB S2 7 STANDARD\n\n(b) explain, for each climate-related risk the entity has identified, whether the entity considers the risk\nto be a climate-related physical risk or climate-related transition risk;\n(c) specify, for each climate-related risk and opportunity the entity has identified, over which time\nhorizons—short, medium or long term—the effects of each climate-related risk and opportunity\ncould reasonably be expected to occur; and\n(d) explain how the entity defines ‘short term’, ‘medium term’ and ‘long term’ and how these\ndefinitions are linked to the planning horizons used by the entity for strategic decision-making.\n11 In identifying the climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s\nprospects, the entity shall use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the\nreporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and\nforecasts of future conditions.\n12 [Deleted by the AASB]\nBusiness model and value chain\n13 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand the\ncurrent and anticipated effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s business model and\nvalue chain. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:\n(a) a description of the current and anticipated effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on the\nentity’s business model and value chain; and\n(b) a description of where in the entity’s business model and value chain climate-related risks and\nopportunities are concentrated (for example, geographical areas, facilities and types of assets).\nStrategy and decision-making\n14 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand the\neffects of climate-related risks and opportunities on its strategy and decision-making. Specifically, the entity\nshall disclose:\n(a) information about how the entity has responded to, and plans to respond to, climate-related risks\nand opportunities in its strategy and decision-making, including how the entity plans to achieve any\nclimate-related targets it has set and any targets it is required to meet by law or regulation.\nSpecifically, the entity shall disclose information about:\n(i) current and anticipated changes to the entity’s business model, including its resource\nallocation, to address climate-related risks and opportunities (for example, these changes\ncould include plans to manage or decommission carbon-, energy- or water-intensive\noperations; resource allocations resulting from demand or supply-chain changes; resource\nallocations arising from business development through capital expenditure or additional\nexpenditure on research and development; and acquisitions or divestments);\n(ii) current and anticipated direct mitigation and adaptation efforts (for example, through\nchanges in production processes or equipment, relocation of facilities, workforce\nadjustments, and changes in product specifications);\n(iii) current and anticipated indirect mitigation and adaptation efforts (for example, through\nworking with customers and supply chains);\n(iv) any climate-related transition plan the entity has, including information about key\nassumptions used in developing its transition plan, and dependencies on which the\nentity’s transition plan relies; and\n(v) how the entity plans to achieve any climate-related targets, including any greenhouse gas\nemissions targets, described in accordance with paragraphs 33–36.\n(b) information about how the entity is resourcing, and plans to resource, the activities disclosed in\naccordance with paragraph 14(a).\n(c) quantitative and qualitative information about the progress of plans disclosed in previous reporting\nperiods in accordance with paragraph 14(a).\nAASB S2 8 STANDARD",

The\nentity shall use climate-related scenario analysis to assess its climate resilience using an approach that is\ncommensurate with the entity’s circumstances (see paragraphs B1–B18). In providing quantitative\ninformation, the entity may disclose a single amount or a range. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:\n(a) the entity’s assessment of its climate resilience as at the reporting date, which shall enable users of\ngeneral purpose financial reports to understand:\n(i) the implications, if any, of the entity’s assessment for its strategy and business model,\nincluding how the entity would need to respond to the effects identified in the climate-\nrelated scenario analysis;\n(ii) the significant areas of uncertainty considered in the entity’s assessment of its climate\nresilience;\n(iii) the entity’s capacity to adjust or adapt its strategy and business model to climate change\nover the short, medium and long term, including;\n(1) the availability of, and flexibility in, the entity’s existing financial resources to\nrespond to the effects identified in the climate-related scenario analysis,\nincluding to address climate-related risks and to take advantage of climate-\nrelated opportunities;\n(2) the entity’s ability to redeploy, repurpose, upgrade or decommission existing\nassets; and\n(3) the effect of the entity’s current and planned investments in climate-related\nmitigation, adaptation and opportunities for climate resilience; and\n(b) how and when the climate-related scenario analysis was carried out, including:\n(i) information about the inputs the entity used, including:\n(1) which climate-related scenarios the entity used for the analysis and the sources\nof those scenarios;\n(2) whether the analysis included a diverse range of climate-related scenarios;\n(3) whether the climate-related scenarios used for the analysis are associated with\nclimate-related transition risks or climate-related physical risks;\n(4) whether the entity used, among its scenarios, a climate-related scenario aligned\nwith the latest international agreement on climate change;\n(5) why the entity decided that its chosen climate-related scenarios are relevant to\nassessing its resilience to climate-related changes, developments or\nuncertainties;\n(6) the time horizons the entity used in the analysis; and\n(7) what scope of operations the entity used in the analysis (for example, the\noperating locations and business units used in the analysis);\n(ii) the key assumptions the entity made in the analysis, including assumptions about:\n(1) climate-related policies in the jurisdictions in which the entity operates;\n(2) macroeconomic trends;\n(3) national- or regional-level variables (for example, local weather patterns,\ndemographics, land use, infrastructure and availability of natural resources);\n(4) energy usage and mix; and\n(5) developments in technology; and\n(iii) the reporting period in which the climate-related scenario analysis was carried out (see\nparagraph B18).\n23 [Deleted by the AASB]\nAus23.1 In preparing disclosures to meet the requirements in paragraphs 13–22, an entity shall refer to and\nconsider the applicability of cross-industry metric categories, as described in paragraph 29.\nAASB S2 10 STANDARD\n\nRisk management\n24 The objective of climate-related financial disclosures on risk management is to enable users of general\npurpose financial reports to understand an entity’s processes to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor\nclimate-related risks and opportunities, including whether and how those processes are integrated into\nand inform the entity’s overall risk management process.\n25 To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:\n(a) the processes and related policies the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor climate-\nrelated risks, including information about:\n(i) the inputs and parameters the entity uses (for example, information about data sources\nand the scope of operations covered in the processes);\n(ii) whether and how the entity uses climate-related scenario analysis to inform its\nidentification of climate-related risks;\n(iii) how the entity assesses the nature, likelihood and magnitude of the effects of those risks\n(for example, whether the entity considers qualitative factors, quantitative thresholds or\nother criteria);\n(iv) whether and how the entity prioritises climate-related risks relative to other types of risk;\n(v) how the entity monitors climate-related risks; and\n(vi) whether and how the entity has changed the processes it uses compared with the previous\nreporting period;\n(b) the processes the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor climate-related opportunities,\nincluding information about whether and how the entity uses climate-related scenario analysis to\ninform its identification of climate-related opportunities; and\n(c) the extent to which, and how, the processes for identifying, assessing, prioritising and monitoring\nclimate-related risks and opportunities are integrated into and inform the entity’s overall risk\nmanagement process.\n26 In preparing disclosures to fulfil the requirements in paragraph 25, an entity shall avoid unnecessary\nduplication in accordance with Appendix D (see paragraph B42(b) in Appendix D). For example, although an\nentity shall provide the information required by paragraph 25, if oversight of sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities is managed on an integrated basis, the entity would avoid duplication by providing integrated\nrisk management disclosures instead of separate disclosures for each sustainability-related risk and\nopportunity.\nAus26.1 The requirement in paragraph 26 to avoid unnecessary duplication applies particularly if an entity\nelects to voluntarily apply AASB S1 to disclose information about other sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities in addition to climate-related risks and opportunities in general purpose financial\nreports.\nMetrics and targets\n27 The objective of climate-related financial disclosures on metrics and targets is to enable users of general\npurpose financial reports to understand an entity’s performance in relation to its climate-related risks\nand opportunities, including progress towards any climate-related targets it has set, and any targets it\nis required to meet by law or regulation.\n28 To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose:\n(a) information relevant to the cross-industry metric categories (see paragraphs 29–31);

Climate resilience involves the capacity to manage climate-related risks\nand benefit from climate-related opportunities, including the ability to respond and\nadapt to climate-related transition risks and climate-related physical risks. An\nentity’s climate resilience includes both its strategic resilience and its operational\nresilience to climate-related changes, developments and uncertainties.\nclimate-related physical Risks resulting from climate change that can be event-driven (acute physical risk) or\nrisks from longer-term shifts in climatic patterns (chronic physical risk). Acute physical risks\narise from weather-related events such as storms, floods, drought or heatwaves, which\nare increasing in severity and frequency. Chronic physical risks arise from longer-term\nshifts in climatic patterns including changes in precipitation and temperature which\ncould lead to sea level rise, reduced water availability, biodiversity loss and changes in\nsoil productivity.\nThese risks could carry financial implications for an entity, such as costs resulting from\ndirect damage to assets or indirect effects of supply-chain disruption. The entity's\nfinancial performance could also be affected by changes in water availability, sourcing\nand quality; and extreme temperature changes affecting the entity's premises,\noperations, supply chains, transportation needs and employee health and safety.\nclimate-related risks and Climate-related risks refers to the potential negative effects of climate change on an\nopportunities entity. These risks are categorised as climate-related physical risks and climate-\nrelated transition risks.\nClimate-related opportunities refers to the potential positive effects arising from climate\nchange for an entity. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce\nclimate-related opportunities for an entity.\nclimate-related An aspect of an entity’s overall strategy that lays out the entity’s targets, actions or\ntransition plan resources for its transition towards a lower-carbon economy, including actions such as\nreducing its greenhouse gas emissions.\nclimate-related Risks that arise from efforts to transition to a lower-carbon economy. Transition risks\ntransition risks include policy, legal, technological, market and reputational risks. These risks could\ncarry financial implications for an entity, such as increased operating costs or asset\nimpairment due to new or amended climate-related regulations.

Paragraphs B2–B18 provide guidance on how\nan entity uses scenario analysis to assess the entity’s climate resilience. Specifically:\n(a) paragraphs B2–B7 set out the factors the entity shall consider when assessing its circumstances;\n(b) paragraphs B8–B15 set out the factors the entity shall consider when determining an appropriate\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis; and\n(c) paragraphs B16–B18 set out additional factors for the entity to consider when determining its\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis over time.\nAssessing the circumstances\nB2 An entity shall use an approach to climate-related scenario analysis that is commensurate with its\ncircumstances as at the time the entity carries out its climate-related scenario analysis (see paragraph B3). To\nassess its circumstances the entity shall consider:\n(a) the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs B4–B5); and\n(b) the skills, capabilities and resources available to the entity for the climate-related scenario analysis\n(see paragraphs B6–B7).\nB3 An entity shall assess its circumstances each time it carries out its climate-related scenario analysis. For\nexample, an entity that carries out its climate-related scenario analysis every three years to align with its\nstrategic planning cycle (see paragraph B18) would be required to reconsider for this purpose its exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities and resources available at that time.\nExposure to climate-related risks and opportunities\nB4 An entity shall consider its exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities in its assessment of its\ncircumstances and when determining the approach to use for its climate-related scenario analysis. This\nconsideration provides essential context for understanding the potential benefits of using a particular approach\nto climate-related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has a high degree of exposure to climate-related\nrisk then a more quantitative or technically sophisticated approach to climate-related scenario analysis would\nbe of greater benefit to the entity and users of general purpose financial reports. Users of general purpose\nfinancial reports would be less likely to benefit from quantitative or technically sophisticated climate-related\nscenario analysis if the entity is exposed to few or relatively less severe climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThis means that—with all else being equal—the greater the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks or\nopportunities, the more likely it is the entity would determine that a more technically sophisticated form of\nclimate-related scenario analysis is required.\nB5 This Standard requires an entity to identify the climate-related risks and opportunities to which it is exposed\n(see paragraph 10) and to disclose information about the process the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise\nand monitor those risks and opportunities (see paragraph 25). The information the entity discloses in\naccordance with paragraphs 10 and 25 can inform the entity’s consideration of its exposure to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities.\n2 This application guidance (paragraphs B1–B18) draws on the range of practice outlined in documents published by the Task Force on\nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), including Technical Supplement: The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-\nrelated Risks and Opportunities (2017) and Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies (2020).\nAASB S2 18 APPENDIX B\n\nSkills, capabilities and resources available\nB6 An entity shall consider the available skills, capabilities and resources when determining an appropriate\napproach to use for its climate-related scenario analysis. These skills, capabilities and resources might include\nboth internal and external skills, capabilities and resources. The entity’s available skills, capabilities and\nresources provide context to inform its consideration of the potential cost and level of effort required by a\nparticular approach to climate-related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has only just begun to\nexplore the use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess its climate resilience, it might be unable to use a\nquantitative or technically sophisticated approach to climate-related scenario analysis without undue cost or\neffort. For the avoidance of doubt, if resources are available to the entity then it will be able to invest in\nobtaining or developing the necessary skills and capabilities.\nB7 Climate-related scenario analysis can be resource intensive and might—through an iterative learning\nprocess—be developed and refined over multiple planning cycles. As an entity repeats the climate-related\nscenario analysis, it is likely to develop skills and capabilities that will enable the entity to strengthen its\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis over time. For example, if an entity has not yet used climate-\nrelated scenario analysis or participates in an industry where climate-related scenario analysis is not commonly\nused, the entity might need more time to develop its skills and capabilities. In contrast, an entity in an industry\nwhere climate-related scenario analysis is established practice—such as extractives and mineral processing—\nwould be expected to have strengthened its skills and capabilities through its experience.\nDetermining the appropriate approach\nB8 An entity shall determine an approach to climate-related scenario analysis that enables it to consider all\nreasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost\nor effort. The determination of the approach shall be informed by the assessments of the entity’s exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs B4–B5) and its available skills, capabilities and\nresources (see paragraphs B6–B7). Making such a determination involves:\n(a) selecting inputs to the climate-related scenario analysis (see paragraphs B11–B13); and\n(b) making analytical choices about how to carry out the climate-related scenario analysis (see\nparagraphs B14–B15).\nB9 Reasonable and supportable information includes information about past events, current conditions and\nforecasts of future conditions. It also includes quantitative or qualitative information, and information that is\nobtained from an external source or owned or developed internally.\nB10 An entity will need to use judgement to determine the mix of inputs and analytical choices that will enable the\nentity to consider all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date\nwithout undue cost or effort. The degree of judgement that is required depends on the availability of detailed\ninformation. As the time horizon increases and the availability of detailed information decreases, the degree\nof judgement required increases.\nSelecting inputs\nB11 When an entity selects the inputs to use in its climate-related scenario analysis, the entity shall consider all\nreasonable and supportable information—including scenarios, variables and other inputs—available to the\nentity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The inputs used in scenario analysis might include\ninformation that is qualitative or quantitative, and is obtained from an external source or developed internally.\nFor example, publicly available climate-related scenarios—from authoritative sources—that describe future\ntrends and a range of pathways to plausible outcomes are considered to be available to the entity without undue\ncost or effort.\nB12 When selecting scenarios, variables and other inputs to use in climate-related scenario analysis, an entity\nmight, for example, use one or more climate-related scenarios—including international and regional\nscenarios—that are publicly and freely available from authoritative sources. The entity shall have a reasonable\nand supportable basis for using a particular scenario or set of scenarios. For example, an entity with operations\nconcentrated in a jurisdiction where emissions are regulated—or are likely to be regulated in the future—\nmight determine that it is appropriate to carry out its analysis using a scenario consistent with an orderly\ntransition to a lower-carbon economy or consistent with relevant jurisdictional commitments to the latest\ninternational agreement on climate change. Elsewhere, for example, an entity with heightened exposure to\nphysical climate-related risks might determine that it is appropriate to carry out its analysis using a localised\nclimate-related scenario that takes into account current policies.\nB13 In considering whether the selected inputs are reasonable and supportable, an entity shall consider the\nobjective of paragraph 22, which requires the entity to disclose information that enables users of general\nAASB S2 19 APPENDIX B\n\npurpose financial reports to understand the resilience of the entity’s strategy and business model to climate-\nrelated changes, developments and uncertainties, taking into consideration the entity’s identified climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities. This means that the inputs to the entity’s climate-related scenario analysis shall\nbe relevant to the entity’s circumstances, for example, to the particular activities the entity undertakes and the\ngeographical location of those activities.\nMaking analytical choices\nB14 An entity’s resilience assessment will be informed not only by the individual inputs to its climate-related\nscenario analysis, but also by the information it develops in combining those inputs to carry out the analysis.\nThe entity shall prioritise the analytical choices (for example, whether to use qualitative analysis or\nquantitative modelling) that will enable it to consider all reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. For example, if an entity is able—\nwithout undue cost or effort—to incorporate multiple carbon price pathways associated with a given outcome\n(for example, a 1.5 degree Celsius outcome), this analysis is likely to strengthen the entity’s resilience\nassessment, assuming such an approach is warranted by the entity’s risk exposure.\nB15 Quantitative information will often enable an entity to carry out a more robust assessment of its climate\nresilience. However, qualitative information (including scenario narratives), either alone or combined with\nquantitative data, can also provide a reasonable and supportable basis for the entity’s resilience assessment.\nAdditional considerations\nB16 Climate-related scenario analysis is an evolving practice and, therefore, the approach that an entity uses is\nlikely to change over time. As described in paragraphs B2–B7, the entity shall determine its approach to\nclimate-related scenario analysis based on its particular circumstances, including the entity’s exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities and resources available for the scenario\nanalysis. Those circumstances are also likely to change over time. Therefore, the entity’s approach to climate-\nrelated scenario analysis need not be the same from one reporting period or strategic planning cycle to the\nnext (see paragraph B18).\nB17 An entity might use a simpler approach to climate-related scenario analysis, such as qualitative scenario\nnarratives, if such an approach is appropriate to the entity’s circumstances. For example, if an entity does not\ncurrently have the skills, capabilities or resources to carry out quantitative climate-related scenario analysis\nbut has a high degree of exposure to climate-related risk, the entity might initially use a simpler approach to\nclimate-related scenario analysis, but would build its capabilities through experience and, therefore, would\napply a more advanced quantitative approach to climate-related scenario analysis over time. An entity with a\nhigh degree of exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, and with access to the necessary skills,\ncapabilities or resources, is required to apply a more advanced quantitative approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis.\nB18 Although paragraph 22 requires an entity to disclose information about its climate resilience at each reporting\ndate, the entity might carry out its climate-related scenario analysis in line with its strategic planning cycle,\nincluding a multi-year strategic planning cycle (for example, every three to five years). Therefore, in some\nreporting periods the entity’s disclosures in accordance with paragraph 22(b) could remain unchanged from\nthe previous reporting period if the entity does not conduct a scenario analysis annually. The entity shall—at\na minimum—update its climate-related scenario analysis in line with its strategic planning cycle. However,\nan assessment of the entity’s resilience is required to be carried out annually to reflect updated insight into the\nimplications of climate uncertainty for the entity’s business model and strategy. As such, an entity’s disclosure\nin accordance with paragraph 22(a)—that is, the results of the entity’s resilience assessment—shall be updated\nat each reporting period.\nGreenhouse gases (paragraph 29(a))\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nPermission to use information from a reporting period that is different from the\nentity’s reporting period, in specific circumstances\nB19 An entity might have a different reporting period from some or all of the entities in its value chain. Such a\ndifference would mean that greenhouse gas emissions information from these entities in its value chain for the\nentity’s reporting period might not be readily available for the entity to use for its own disclosure. In such\ncircumstances, the entity is permitted to measure its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with\nAASB S2 20 APPENDIX B\n\nparagraph 29(a)(i) using information for reporting periods that are different from its own reporting period if\nthat information is obtained from entities in its value chain with reporting periods that are different from the\nentity’s reporting period, on the condition that:\n(a) the entity uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain without undue\ncost or effort to measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;\n(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and\n(c) the entity discloses the effects of significant events and changes in circumstances (relevant to its\ngreenhouse gas emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in its value chain\nand the date of the entity’s general purpose financial reports.\nAggregation of greenhouse gases into CO equivalent using global warming\npotential values\nB20 Paragraph 29(a) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross greenhouse gas emissions generated during\nthe reporting period, expressed as metric tonnes of CO equivalent. To meet this requirement, the entity shall\naggregate the seven constituent greenhouse gases into CO equivalent values.\nB21 If an entity uses direct measurement to measure its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is required to convert\nthe seven constituent greenhouse gases into a CO equivalent value using global warming potential values\nbased on a 100-year time horizon, from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment\navailable at the reporting date.\nB22 If an entity uses emission factors to estimate its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity shall use—as its basis\nfor measuring its greenhouse gas emissions—the emission factors that best represent the entity’s activity (see\nparagraph B29). If these emission factors have already converted the constituent gases into CO equivalent\nvalues, the entity is not required to recalculate the emission factors using global warming potential values\nbased on a 100-year time horizon from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment\navailable at the reporting date. However, if an entity uses emission factors that are not converted into CO\nequivalent values, then the entity shall use the global warming potential values based on a 100-year time\nhorizon from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment available at the reporting date.\nAusB22.1 For the purposes of paragraphs B21 and B22, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nassessment available at the reporting date means the Panel’s Sixth Assessment Report.\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol\nB23 Paragraph 29(a)(ii) requires an entity to disclose its greenhouse gas emissions measured in accordance with\nthe Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004). For the avoidance of\ndoubt, an entity shall apply the requirements in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and\nReporting Standard (2004) only to the extent that they do not conflict with the requirements in this Standard.\nFor example, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) does not\nrequire an entity to disclose its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, however, the entity is required to disclose\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a).\nB24 An entity is required to use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\n(2004) unless the entity is required by a jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a\ndifferent method for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. If the entity is required by a jurisdictional\nauthority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a different method for measuring its greenhouse gas\nemissions, the entity is permitted to use this method rather than using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A\nCorporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) for as long as the jurisdictional or exchange requirement\napplies to the entity.\nB25 In some circumstances, an entity might be subject to a requirement in the jurisdiction in which it operates to\ndisclose its greenhouse gas emissions for a specific part of the entity or for some of its greenhouse gas\nemissions (for example, only for Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions). In such circumstances, the\njurisdictional requirement does not exempt the entity from applying the requirements in this Standard to\ndisclose the entity’s Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for the entity as a whole.\nMeasurement approach, inputs and assumptions\nB26 Paragraph 29(a)(iii) requires an entity to disclose the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it uses\nto measure its greenhouse gas emissions. As part of this requirement, the entity shall include information\nabout:\nAASB S2 21 APPENDIX B\n\n(a) the measurement approach the entity uses in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A\nCorporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) (see paragraph B27);\n(b) the applicable method if the entity is not using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate\nAccounting and Reporting Standard (2004) and the measurement approach the entity uses (see\nparagraph B28); and\n(c) the emission factors the entity uses (see paragraph B29).\nThe measurement approach set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\nB27 The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) includes different\nmeasurement approaches that an entity might use when measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. In disclosing\ninformation in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii), the entity is required to disclose information about the\nmeasurement approach it uses. For example, when the entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured\nin accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004),\nthe entity is required to use the equity share or control approach. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:\n(a) the approach it uses to determine its greenhouse gas emissions (for example, the equity share or\ncontrol approach in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\n(2004)); and\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity’s choice of measurement approach and how that approach\nrelates to the disclosure objective in paragraph 27.\nOther methods and measurement approaches\nB28 When an entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured in accordance with another method, applying\nparagraphs 29(a)(ii), B24–B25 or C4(a), the entity shall disclose:\n(a) the applicable method and measurement approach the entity uses to determine its greenhouse gas\nemissions; and\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity’s choice of method and measurement approach and how that\napproach relates to the disclosure objective in paragraph 27.\nEmission factors\nB29 As part of an entity’s disclosure of the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions, the entity shall disclose\ninformation to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand which emission factors the\nentity uses in its measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions. This Standard does not specify emission factors\nan entity is required to use in its measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, this Standard requires\nan entity to use emission factors that best represent the entity’s activity as its basis for measuring its greenhouse\ngas emissions.\nScope 2 greenhouse gas emissions\nB30 Paragraph 29(a)(v) requires an entity to disclose its location-based Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and\nprovide information about any contractual instruments the entity has entered into that could inform users’\nunderstanding of the entity’s Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. For the avoidance of doubt, an entity is\nrequired to disclose its Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions using a location-based approach and is required to\nprovide information about contractual instruments only if such instruments exist and information about them\ninforms users’ understanding of an entity’s Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB31 Contractual instruments are any type of contract between an entity and another party for the sale and purchase\nof energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims\n(unbundled energy attribute claims relate to the sale and purchase of energy that is separate and distinct from\nthe greenhouse gas attribute contractual instruments). Various types of contractual instruments are available\nin different markets and the entity might disclose information about its market-based Scope 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions as part of its disclosure.\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nB32 In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), an entity shall disclose information about its Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the source of these emissions. The\nentity shall consider its entire value chain (upstream and downstream) and shall consider all 15 categories of\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, as described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain\nAASB S2 22 APPENDIX B\n\n(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011). In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), the entity shall\ndisclose which of these categories are included in its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.\nB33 For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the method an entity uses to measure its greenhouse gas emissions,\nthe entity is required to disclose the categories included within its measure of Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions as described in paragraph 29(a)(vi)(1).\nB34 On the occurrence of a significant event or a significant change in circumstances, an entity shall reassess the\nscope of all affected climate-related risks and opportunities throughout its value chain, including reassessing\nwhich Scope 3 categories and entities throughout its value chain to include in the measurement of its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. A significant event or significant change in circumstances can occur without the\nentity being involved in that event or change in circumstances or as a result of a change in what the entity\nassesses to be important to users of general purpose financial reports. For example, such significant events or\nsignificant changes in circumstances might include:\n(a) a significant change in the entity's value chain (for example, a supplier in the entity's value chain\nmakes a change that significantly alters the supplier’s greenhouse gas emissions);\n(b) a significant change in the entity’s business model, activities or corporate structure (for example, a\nmerger or acquisition that expands the entity's value chain); and\n(c) a significant change in the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (for example,\na supplier in the entity’s value chain is affected by the introduction of an emissions regulation that\nthe entity had not anticipated).\nB35 An entity is permitted, but not required, to reassess the scope of any climate-related risk or opportunity\nthroughout its value chain more frequently than required by paragraph B34.\nB36 To determine the scope of the value chain, which includes its breadth and composition, an entity shall use all\nreasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost\nor effort.\nB37 An entity that participates in one or more financial activities associated with asset management, commercial\nbanking and insurance shall disclose additional information about the financed emissions associated with those\nactivities as part of the entity’s disclosure of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraphs B58–\nAusB63.1).\nScope 3 measurement framework\nB38 An entity’s measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is likely to include the use of estimation rather\nthan solely comprising direct measurement. In measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions an entity shall\nuse a measurement approach, inputs and assumptions that result in a faithful representation of this\nmeasurement. The measurement framework described in paragraphs B40–B54 provides guidance for an entity\nto use in preparing its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.\nB39 An entity is required to use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the\nreporting date without undue cost or effort when the entity selects the measurement approach, inputs and\nassumptions it uses in measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB40 An entity’s measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions relies upon a range of inputs. This Standard\ndoes not specify the inputs the entity is required to use to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, but\ndoes require the entity to prioritise inputs and assumptions using these identifying characteristics (which are\nlisted in no particular order):\n(a) data based on direct measurement (paragraphs B43–B45);\n(b) data from specific activities within the entity’s value chain (paragraphs B46–B49);\n(c) timely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the technology used for, the value chain\nactivity and its greenhouse gas emissions (paragraphs B50–B52); and\n(d) data that has been verified (paragraphs B53–B54).\nB41 An entity is required to apply the Scope 3 measurement framework to prioritise inputs and assumptions even\nwhen the entity is required by a jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which the entity is listed to use a\nmethod other than the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) for\nmeasuring its greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraphs B24–B25), or whether the entity uses the transition\nrelief described in paragraph C4(a).\nB42 An entity’s prioritisation of the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions and the entity’s considerations\nof associated trade-offs—based on the characteristics in paragraph B40—requires management to apply\njudgement. For example, an entity might need to consider the trade-offs between timely data and data that is\nAASB S2 23 APPENDIX B\n\nmore representative of the jurisdiction and technology used for the value chain activity and its emissions. More\nrecent data might provide less detail about the specific activity, including the technology that was used in the\nvalue chain and the location of that activity. On the other hand, older data that is published infrequently might\nbe considered more representative of the specific activity and its greenhouse gas emissions.\nData based on direct measurement\nB43 Two methods are used to quantify Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions: direct measurement and estimation. Of\nthese two methods—and with all else being equal—an entity shall prioritise direct measurement.\nB44 ‘Direct measurement’ refers to the direct monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions and, in theory, provides the\nmost accurate evidence. However, it is expected that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data will include\nestimation due to the challenges associated with direct measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB45 Estimation of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions involves approximate calculations of data based on\nassumptions and appropriate inputs. An entity that measures its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions using\nestimation is likely to use two types of input:\n(a) data that represents the entity’s activity that results in greenhouse gas emissions (activity data). For\nexample, the entity might use distance travelled as activity data to represent the transport of goods\nwithin its value chain.\n(b) emission factors that convert activity data into greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the entity\nwill convert the distance travelled (activity data) into greenhouse gas emissions data using emission\nfactors.\nData from specific activities within the entity’s value chain\nB46 An entity’s measurement of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will be based on data obtained directly from\nspecific activities within the entity’s value chain (primary data), data not obtained directly from activities\nwithin the entity’s value chain (secondary data), or a combination of both.\nB47 In measuring an entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, primary data is more likely to be representative\nof the entity’s value chain activity and its greenhouse gas emissions than secondary data. Therefore, the entity\nshall prioritise—with all else being equal—the use of primary data.\nB48 Primary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions includes data provided by suppliers or other entities in the\nvalue chain related to specific activities in an entity’s value chain. For example, primary data could be sourced\nfrom meter readings, utility bills or other methods that represent specific activities in the entity’s value chain.\nPrimary data could be collected internally (for example, through the entity’s own records), or externally from\nsuppliers and other value chain partners (for example, supplier-specific emission factors for purchased goods\nor services). Data from specific activities within an entity’s value chain provides a more accurate\nrepresentation of the entity’s specific value chain activities and, therefore, will provide a better basis for\nmeasuring the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB49 Secondary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is data that is not obtained directly from specific\nactivities within an entity’s value chain. Secondary data is often supplied by third-party data providers and\nincludes industry-average data (for example, from published databases, government statistics, literature\nstudies and industry associations). Secondary data includes data used to approximate the activity or emission\nfactors. Additionally, secondary data includes primary data from a specific activity (proxy data) used to\nestimate greenhouse gas emissions for another activity. If an entity uses secondary data to measure its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions, it shall consider the extent to which the data faithfully represents the entity’s\nactivities.\nTimely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the technology used for,\nthe value chain activity and its greenhouse gas emissions\nB50 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise the use of activity or emissions data that is based on, or\nrepresents, the technology used in the value chain activity the data is intended to represent. For example, an\nentity might obtain primary data from its activities (for example, the specific aircraft model, distance travelled\nand travel-class used by employees when travelling) and would then use secondary data that represents the\ngreenhouse gas emissions arising from those activities to convert the primary data into an estimate of its\ngreenhouse gas emissions from air travel.\nB51 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data that is based on, or represents, the\njurisdiction in which the activity happened. For example, an entity shall prioritise emission factors that relate\nto the jurisdiction in which the entity operates or in which the activity has taken place.\nAASB S2 24 APPENDIX B",

    "content": "B52 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data that is timely and representative\nof the entity’s value chain activity during the reporting period. In some jurisdictions, and for some\ntechnologies, secondary data is collected annually and, therefore, the data is likely to be representative of the\nentity’s current practice. However, some secondary data sources rely on information collected in a reporting\nperiod that is different from the entity’s own reporting period.\nVerified data\nB53 An entity shall prioritise Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data that is verified. Verification can provide users\nof general purpose financial reports with confidence that the information is complete, neutral and accurate.\nB54 Verified data might include data that has been internally or externally verified. Verification can take place in\nseveral ways, including on-site checking, reviewing calculations, or cross-checking of data against other\nsources. However, in some cases an entity might be unable to verify its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nwithout undue cost or effort. For example, the entity might be prevented from obtaining a complete set of\nverified data due to the volume of data or because the data is obtained from entities in the value chain that are\nseparated by many tiers from the reporting entity, that is, entities that the reporting entity does not interact\nwith directly. In such cases, an entity might need to use unverified data.\nDisclosure of inputs to Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nB55 An entity shall disclose information about the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it uses to\nmeasure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii). This disclosure shall\ninclude information about the characteristics of the data inputs as described in paragraph B40. The purpose of\nthis disclosure is to provide users of general purpose financial reports with information about how the entity\nhas prioritised the highest quality data available, which faithfully represents the value chain activity and its\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. This disclosure also helps users of general purpose financial reports to\nunderstand why the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions the entity uses to estimate its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions are relevant.\nB56 As part of the requirement in paragraph 29(a)(iii), and to reflect how an entity prioritises Scope 3 data in\naccordance with the measurement framework set out in paragraphs B40–B54, the entity shall disclose\ninformation that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand:\n(a) the extent to which the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are measured using inputs from\nspecific activities within the entity’s value chain; and\n(b) the extent to which the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are measured using inputs that\nare verified.\nB57 This Standard includes the presumption that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions can be estimated reliably using\nsecondary data and industry averages. In those rare cases when an entity determines it is impracticable to\nestimate its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, the entity shall disclose how it is managing its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Applying a requirement is impracticable when the entity cannot apply it after\nmaking every reasonable effort to do so.\nFinanced emissions\nB58 Entities participating in financial activities face risks and opportunities related to the greenhouse gas emissions\nassociated with those activities. Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher greenhouse gas emissions\nmight be susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy\nchange, which in turn can affect the financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities.\nThese risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other\nfinancial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by\nincreasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise\nthrough technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects. Entities\nparticipating in financial activities, including commercial and investment banks, asset managers and insurance\nentities, are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This\nmeasurement serves as an indicator of an entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how\nthe entity might need to adapt its financial activities over time.\nB59 Paragraph 29 (a)(i)(3) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\ngenerated during the reporting period, including upstream and downstream emissions. An entity that\nparticipates in one or more of the following financial activities is required to disclose additional and specific\ninformation about its Category 15 emissions or those emissions associated with its investments which is also\nknown as ‘financed emissions’:\nAASB S2 25 APPENDIX B\n\n(a) asset management (see paragraph B61);\n(b) commercial banking (see paragraph B62); and\n(c) insurance (see paragraph B63).\nB60 An entity shall apply the requirements for disclosing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with\nparagraph 29(a) when disclosing information about its financed emissions.\nAsset management\nB61 An entity that participates in asset management activities shall disclose:\n(a) its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions.\n(b) for each of the disaggregated items in paragraph B61(a), the total amount of assets under\nmanagement (AUM) that is included in the financed emissions disclosure, expressed in the\npresentation currency of the entity’s financial statements.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s total AUM included in the financed emissions calculation. If the\npercentage is less than 100%, the entity shall disclose information that explains the exclusions,\nincluding types of assets and associated amount of AUM.\n(d) the methodology used to calculate the financed emissions, including the method of allocation the\nentity used to attribute its share of emissions in relation to the size of investments.\nCommercial banking\nB62 An entity that participates in commercial banking activities shall disclose:\n(a) its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions for each industry by asset class. When disaggregating by:\n(i) industry—the entity shall use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) 6-digit\nindustry-level code for classifying counterparties, reflecting the latest version of the\nclassification system available at the reporting date.\n(ii) asset class—the disclosure shall include loans, project finance, bonds, equity investments\nand undrawn loan commitments. If the entity calculates and discloses financed emissions\nfor other asset classes, it shall include an explanation of why the inclusion of those\nadditional asset classes provides relevant information to users of general purpose\nfinancial reports.\n(b) its gross exposure to each industry by asset class, expressed in the presentation currency of the\nentity’s financial statements. For:\n(i) funded amounts—gross exposure shall be calculated as the funded carrying amounts\n(before subtracting the loss allowance, when applicable), whether prepared in accordance\nwith Australian Accounting Standards or other GAAP.\n(ii) undrawn loan commitments—the entity shall disclose the full amount of the commitment\nseparately from the drawn portion of loan commitments.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions calculation. The\nentity shall:\n(i) if the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions\ncalculation is less than 100%, disclose information that explains the exclusions, including\nthe type of assets excluded.\n(ii) for funded amounts, exclude from gross exposure all impacts of risk mitigants, if\napplicable.\n(iii) disclose separately the percentage of its undrawn loan commitments included in the\nfinanced emissions calculation.\n(d) the methodology the entity used to calculate its financed emissions, including the method of\nallocation the entity used to attribute its share of emissions in relation to the size of its gross\nexposure.\nAASB S2 26 APPENDIX B\n\nInsurance\nB63 An entity that participates in financial activities associated with the insurance industry shall disclose:\n(a) its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions for each industry by asset class. When disaggregating by:\n(i) industry—the entity shall use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) 6-digit\nindustry-level code for classifying counterparties, reflecting the latest version of the\nclassification system available at the reporting date.\n(ii) asset class—the disclosure shall include loans, bonds and equity investments, as well as\nundrawn loan commitments.

For:\n(i) funded amounts—gross exposure shall be calculated as the funded carrying amounts\n(before subtracting the loss allowance, when applicable), whether prepared in accordance\nwith Australian Accounting Standards or other GAAP.\n(ii) undrawn loan commitments—the entity shall disclose the full amount of the commitment\nseparately from the drawn portion of loan commitments.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions calculation. The\nentity shall:\n(i) if the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions\ncalculation is less than 100%, disclose information that explains the exclusions, including\ntype of assets excluded.\n(ii) disclose separately the percentage of its undrawn loan commitments included in the\nfinanced emissions calculation.\n(d) the methodology the entity used to calculate its financed emissions, including the method of\nallocation the entity used to attribute its share of emissions in relation to the size of its gross\nexposure.\nAusB63.1 For the purposes of paragraphs B62(a)(i) and B63(a)(i), the latest version of the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS) available at the reporting date means the version that incorporates\namendments to August 2024.\nCross-industry metric categories (paragraph 29(b)–(g))\nB64 In addition to information about an entity’s greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is required to disclose\ninformation relevant to the cross-industry metric categories set out in paragraph 29(b)–(g).\nB65 In preparing disclosures to fulfil the requirements in paragraph 29(b)–(g), an entity shall:\n(a) consider the time horizons over which the effects of climate-related risks and opportunities could\nreasonably be expected to occur, described in accordance with paragraph 10.\n(b) consider where in the entity’s business model and value chain climate-related risks and\nopportunities are concentrated (for example, geographical areas, facilities or types of assets) (see\nparagraph 13).\n(c) consider the information disclosed in accordance with paragraph 16(a)–(b) in relation to the effects\nof climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s financial position, financial performance\nand cash flows for the reporting period.\n(d) [deleted by the AASB]\n(e) consider the connections between the information disclosed to fulfil the requirements in\nparagraph 29(b)–(g) with the information disclosed in the related financial statements, in\naccordance with paragraph 21(b)(ii) of Appendix D.

Carbon credits are uniquely\nserialised, issued, tracked and cancelled by means of an electronic registry.\nclimate resilience The capacity of an entity to adjust to climate-related changes, developments or\nuncertainties. Climate resilience involves the capacity to manage climate-related risks\nand benefit from climate-related opportunities, including the ability to respond and\nadapt to climate-related transition risks and climate-related physical risks. An\nentity’s climate resilience includes both its strategic resilience and its operational\nresilience to climate-related changes, developments and uncertainties.\nclimate-related physical Risks resulting from climate change that can be event-driven (acute physical risk) or\nrisks from longer-term shifts in climatic patterns (chronic physical risk). Acute physical risks\narise from weather-related events such as storms, floods, drought or heatwaves, which\nare increasing in severity and frequency. Chronic physical risks arise from longer-term\nshifts in climatic patterns including changes in precipitation and temperature which\ncould lead to sea level rise, reduced water availability, biodiversity loss and changes in\nsoil productivity.\nThese risks could carry financial implications for an entity, such as costs resulting from\ndirect damage to assets or indirect effects of supply-chain disruption. The entity's\nfinancial performance could also be affected by changes in water availability, sourcing\nand quality; and extreme temperature changes affecting the entity's premises,\noperations, supply chains, transportation needs and employee health and safety.\nclimate-related risks and Climate-related risks refers to the potential negative effects of climate change on an\nopportunities entity. These risks are categorised as climate-related physical risks and climate-\nrelated transition risks.\nClimate-related opportunities refers to the potential positive effects arising from climate\nchange for an entity. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce\nclimate-related opportunities for an entity.\nclimate-related An aspect of an entity’s overall strategy that lays out the entity’s targets, actions or\ntransition plan resources for its transition towards a lower-carbon economy, including actions such as\nreducing its greenhouse gas emissions.\nclimate-related Risks that arise from efforts to transition to a lower-carbon economy. Transition risks\ntransition risks include policy, legal, technological, market and reputational risks. These risks could\ncarry financial implications for an entity, such as increased operating costs or asset\nimpairment due to new or amended climate-related regulations. The entity's financial\nperformance could also be affected by shifting consumer demands and the development\nand deployment of new technology.\nCO2 equivalent The universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential of each\ngreenhouse gas, expressed in terms of the global warming potential of one unit of\ncarbon dioxide.

Paragraphs B2–B18 provide guidance on how\nan entity uses scenario analysis to assess the entity’s climate resilience. Specifically:\n(a) paragraphs B2–B7 set out the factors the entity shall consider when assessing its circumstances;\n(b) paragraphs B8–B15 set out the factors the entity shall consider when determining an appropriate\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis; and\n(c) paragraphs B16–B18 set out additional factors for the entity to consider when determining its\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis over time.\nAssessing the circumstances\nB2 An entity shall use an approach to climate-related scenario analysis that is commensurate with its\ncircumstances as at the time the entity carries out its climate-related scenario analysis (see paragraph B3). To\nassess its circumstances the entity shall consider:\n(a) the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs B4–B5); and\n(b) the skills, capabilities and resources available to the entity for the climate-related scenario analysis\n(see paragraphs B6–B7).\nB3 An entity shall assess its circumstances each time it carries out its climate-related scenario analysis. For\nexample, an entity that carries out its climate-related scenario analysis every three years to align with its\nstrategic planning cycle (see paragraph B18) would be required to reconsider for this purpose its exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities and resources available at that time.\nExposure to climate-related risks and opportunities\nB4 An entity shall consider its exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities in its assessment of its\ncircumstances and when determining the approach to use for its climate-related scenario analysis. This\nconsideration provides essential context for understanding the potential benefits of using a particular approach\nto climate-related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has a high degree of exposure to climate-related\nrisk then a more quantitative or technically sophisticated approach to climate-related scenario analysis would\nbe of greater benefit to the entity and users of general purpose financial reports. Users of general purpose\nfinancial reports would be less likely to benefit from quantitative or technically sophisticated climate-related\nscenario analysis if the entity is exposed to few or relatively less severe climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThis means that—with all else being equal—the greater the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks or\nopportunities, the more likely it is the entity would determine that a more technically sophisticated form of\nclimate-related scenario analysis is required.\nB5 This Standard requires an entity to identify the climate-related risks and opportunities to which it is exposed\n(see paragraph 10) and to disclose information about the process the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise\nand monitor those risks and opportunities (see paragraph 25). The information the entity discloses in\naccordance with paragraphs 10 and 25 can inform the entity’s consideration of its exposure to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities.\n2 This application guidance (paragraphs B1–B18) draws on the range of practice outlined in documents published by the Task Force on\nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), including Technical Supplement: The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-\nrelated Risks and Opportunities (2017) and Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies (2020).\nAASB S2 18 APPENDIX B\n\nSkills, capabilities and resources available\nB6 An entity shall consider the available skills, capabilities and resources when determining an appropriate\napproach to use for its climate-related scenario analysis. These skills, capabilities and resources might include\nboth internal and external skills, capabilities and resources. The entity’s available skills, capabilities and\nresources provide context to inform its consideration of the potential cost and level of effort required by a\nparticular approach to climate-related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has only just begun to\nexplore the use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess its climate resilience, it might be unable to use a\nquantitative or technically sophisticated approach to climate-related scenario analysis without undue cost or\neffort. For the avoidance of doubt, if resources are available to the entity then it will be able to invest in\nobtaining or developing the necessary skills and capabilities.\nB7 Climate-related scenario analysis can be resource intensive and might—through an iterative learning\nprocess—be developed and refined over multiple planning cycles. As an entity repeats the climate-related\nscenario analysis, it is likely to develop skills and capabilities that will enable the entity to strengthen its\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis over time. For example, if an entity has not yet used climate-\nrelated scenario analysis or participates in an industry where climate-related scenario analysis is not commonly\nused, the entity might need more time to develop its skills and capabilities. In contrast, an entity in an industry\nwhere climate-related scenario analysis is established practice—such as extractives and mineral processing—\nwould be expected to have strengthened its skills and capabilities through its experience.\nDetermining the appropriate approach\nB8 An entity shall determine an approach to climate-related scenario analysis that enables it to consider all\nreasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost\nor effort. The determination of the approach shall be informed by the assessments of the entity’s exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs B4–B5) and its available skills, capabilities and\nresources (see paragraphs B6–B7). Making such a determination involves:\n(a) selecting inputs to the climate-related scenario analysis (see paragraphs B11–B13); and\n(b) making analytical choices about how to carry out the climate-related scenario analysis (see\nparagraphs B14–B15).\nB9 Reasonable and supportable information includes information about past events, current conditions and\nforecasts of future conditions. It also includes quantitative or qualitative information, and information that is\nobtained from an external source or owned or developed internally.\nB10 An entity will need to use judgement to determine the mix of inputs and analytical choices that will enable the\nentity to consider all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date\nwithout undue cost or effort. The degree of judgement that is required depends on the availability of detailed\ninformation. As the time horizon increases and the availability of detailed information decreases, the degree\nof judgement required increases.\nSelecting inputs\nB11 When an entity selects the inputs to use in its climate-related scenario analysis, the entity shall consider all\nreasonable and supportable information—including scenarios, variables and other inputs—available to the\nentity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The inputs used in scenario analysis might include\ninformation that is qualitative or quantitative, and is obtained from an external source or developed internally.\nFor example, publicly available climate-related scenarios—from authoritative sources—that describe future\ntrends and a range of pathways to plausible outcomes are considered to be available to the entity without undue\ncost or effort.\nB12 When selecting scenarios, variables and other inputs to use in climate-related scenario analysis, an entity\nmight, for example, use one or more climate-related scenarios—including international and regional\nscenarios—that are publicly and freely available from authoritative sources. The entity shall have a reasonable\nand supportable basis for using a particular scenario or set of scenarios. For example, an entity with operations\nconcentrated in a jurisdiction where emissions are regulated—or are likely to be regulated in the future—\nmight determine that it is appropriate to carry out its analysis using a scenario consistent with an orderly\ntransition to a lower-carbon economy or consistent with relevant jurisdictional commitments to the latest\ninternational agreement on climate change. Elsewhere, for example, an entity with heightened exposure to\nphysical climate-related risks might determine that it is appropriate to carry out its analysis using a localised\nclimate-related scenario that takes into account current policies.\nB13 In considering whether the selected inputs are reasonable and supportable, an entity shall consider the\nobjective of paragraph 22, which requires the entity to disclose information that enables users of general\nAASB S2 19 APPENDIX B\n\npurpose financial reports to understand the resilience of the entity’s strategy and business model to climate-\nrelated changes, developments and uncertainties, taking into consideration the entity’s identified climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities. This means that the inputs to the entity’s climate-related scenario analysis shall\nbe relevant to the entity’s circumstances, for example, to the particular activities the entity undertakes and the\ngeographical location of those activities.\nMaking analytical choices\nB14 An entity’s resilience assessment will be informed not only by the individual inputs to its climate-related\nscenario analysis, but also by the information it develops in combining those inputs to carry out the analysis.\nThe entity shall prioritise the analytical choices (for example, whether to use qualitative analysis or\nquantitative modelling) that will enable it to consider all reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. For example, if an entity is able—\nwithout undue cost or effort—to incorporate multiple carbon price pathways associated with a given outcome\n(for example, a 1.5 degree Celsius outcome), this analysis is likely to strengthen the entity’s resilience\nassessment, assuming such an approach is warranted by the entity’s risk exposure.\nB15 Quantitative information will often enable an entity to carry out a more robust assessment of its climate\nresilience. However, qualitative information (including scenario narratives), either alone or combined with\nquantitative data, can also provide a reasonable and supportable basis for the entity’s resilience assessment.\nAdditional considerations\nB16 Climate-related scenario analysis is an evolving practice and, therefore, the approach that an entity uses is\nlikely to change over time. As described in paragraphs B2–B7, the entity shall determine its approach to\nclimate-related scenario analysis based on its particular circumstances, including the entity’s exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities and resources available for the scenario\nanalysis. Those circumstances are also likely to change over time. Therefore, the entity’s approach to climate-\nrelated scenario analysis need not be the same from one reporting period or strategic planning cycle to the\nnext (see paragraph B18).\nB17 An entity might use a simpler approach to climate-related scenario analysis, such as qualitative scenario\nnarratives, if such an approach is appropriate to the entity’s circumstances. For example, if an entity does not\ncurrently have the skills, capabilities or resources to carry out quantitative climate-related scenario analysis\nbut has a high degree of exposure to climate-related risk, the entity might initially use a simpler approach to\nclimate-related scenario analysis, but would build its capabilities through experience and, therefore, would\napply a more advanced quantitative approach to climate-related scenario analysis over time. An entity with a\nhigh degree of exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, and with access to the necessary skills,\ncapabilities or resources, is required to apply a more advanced quantitative approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis.\nB18 Although paragraph 22 requires an entity to disclose information about its climate resilience at each reporting\ndate, the entity might carry out its climate-related scenario analysis in line with its strategic planning cycle,\nincluding a multi-year strategic planning cycle (for example, every three to five years). Therefore, in some\nreporting periods the entity’s disclosures in accordance with paragraph 22(b) could remain unchanged from\nthe previous reporting period if the entity does not conduct a scenario analysis annually. The entity shall—at\na minimum—update its climate-related scenario analysis in line with its strategic planning cycle. However,\nan assessment of the entity’s resilience is required to be carried out annually to reflect updated insight into the\nimplications of climate uncertainty for the entity’s business model and strategy. As such, an entity’s disclosure\nin accordance with paragraph 22(a)—that is, the results of the entity’s resilience assessment—shall be updated\nat each reporting period.\nGreenhouse gases (paragraph 29(a))\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nPermission to use information from a reporting period that is different from the\nentity’s reporting period, in specific circumstances\nB19 An entity might have a different reporting period from some or all of the entities in its value chain. Such a\ndifference would mean that greenhouse gas emissions information from these entities in its value chain for the\nentity’s reporting period might not be readily available for the entity to use for its own disclosure. In such\ncircumstances, the entity is permitted to measure its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with\nAASB S2 20 APPENDIX B\n\nparagraph 29(a)(i) using information for reporting periods that are different from its own reporting period if\nthat information is obtained from entities in its value chain with reporting periods that are different from the\nentity’s reporting period, on the condition that:\n(a) the entity uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain without undue\ncost or effort to measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;\n(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and\n(c) the entity discloses the effects of significant events and changes in circumstances (relevant to its\ngreenhouse gas emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in its value chain\nand the date of the entity’s general purpose financial reports.\nAggregation of greenhouse gases into CO equivalent using global warming\npotential values\nB20 Paragraph 29(a) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross greenhouse gas emissions generated during\nthe reporting period, expressed as metric tonnes of CO equivalent. To meet this requirement, the entity shall\naggregate the seven constituent greenhouse gases into CO equivalent values.\nB21 If an entity uses direct measurement to measure its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is required to convert\nthe seven constituent greenhouse gases into a CO equivalent value using global warming potential values\nbased on a 100-year time horizon, from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment\navailable at the reporting date.\nB22 If an entity uses emission factors to estimate its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity shall use—as its basis\nfor measuring its greenhouse gas emissions—the emission factors that best represent the entity’s activity (see\nparagraph B29). If these emission factors have already converted the constituent gases into CO equivalent\nvalues, the entity is not required to recalculate the emission factors using global warming potential values\nbased on a 100-year time horizon from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment\navailable at the reporting date. However, if an entity uses emission factors that are not converted into CO\nequivalent values, then the entity shall use the global warming potential values based on a 100-year time\nhorizon from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment available at the reporting date.\nAusB22.1 For the purposes of paragraphs B21 and B22, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nassessment available at the reporting date means the Panel’s Sixth Assessment Report.\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol\nB23 Paragraph 29(a)(ii) requires an entity to disclose its greenhouse gas emissions measured in accordance with\nthe Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004). For the avoidance of\ndoubt, an entity shall apply the requirements in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and\nReporting Standard (2004) only to the extent that they do not conflict with the requirements in this Standard.\nFor example, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) does not\nrequire an entity to disclose its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, however, the entity is required to disclose\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a).\nB24 An entity is required to use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\n(2004) unless the entity is required by a jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a\ndifferent method for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. If the entity is required by a jurisdictional\nauthority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a different method for measuring its greenhouse gas\nemissions, the entity is permitted to use this method rather than using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A\nCorporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) for as long as the jurisdictional or exchange requirement\napplies to the entity.\nB25 In some circumstances, an entity might be subject to a requirement in the jurisdiction in which it operates to\ndisclose its greenhouse gas emissions for a specific part of the entity or for some of its greenhouse gas\nemissions (for example, only for Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions). In such circumstances, the\njurisdictional requirement does not exempt the entity from applying the requirements in this Standard to\ndisclose the entity’s Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for the entity as a whole.\nMeasurement approach, inputs and assumptions\nB26 Paragraph 29(a)(iii) requires an entity to disclose the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it uses\nto measure its greenhouse gas emissions. As part of this requirement, the entity shall include information\nabout:\nAASB S2 21 APPENDIX B\n\n(a) the measurement approach the entity uses in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A\nCorporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) (see paragraph B27);\n(b) the applicable method if the entity is not using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate\nAccounting and Reporting Standard (2004) and the measurement approach the entity uses (see\nparagraph B28); and\n(c) the emission factors the entity uses (see paragraph B29).\nThe measurement approach set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\nB27 The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) includes different\nmeasurement approaches that an entity might use when measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. In disclosing\ninformation in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii), the entity is required to disclose information about the\nmeasurement approach it uses. For example, when the entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured\nin accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004),\nthe entity is required to use the equity share or control approach. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:\n(a) the approach it uses to determine its greenhouse gas emissions (for example, the equity share or\ncontrol approach in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\n(2004)); and\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity’s choice of measurement approach and how that approach\nrelates to the disclosure objective in paragraph 27.\nOther methods and measurement approaches\nB28 When an entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured in accordance with another method, applying\nparagraphs 29(a)(ii), B24–B25 or C4(a), the entity shall disclose:\n(a) the applicable method and measurement approach the entity uses to determine its greenhouse gas\nemissions; and\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity’s choice of method and measurement approach and how that\napproach relates to the disclosure objective in paragraph 27.\nEmission factors\nB29 As part of an entity’s disclosure of the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions, the entity shall disclose\ninformation to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand which emission factors the\nentity uses in its measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions. This Standard does not specify emission factors\nan entity is required to use in its measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, this Standard requires\nan entity to use emission factors that best represent the entity’s activity as its basis for measuring its greenhouse\ngas emissions.\nScope 2 greenhouse gas emissions\nB30 Paragraph 29(a)(v) requires an entity to disclose its location-based Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and\nprovide information about any contractual instruments the entity has entered into that could inform users’\nunderstanding of the entity’s Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. For the avoidance of doubt, an entity is\nrequired to disclose its Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions using a location-based approach and is required to\nprovide information about contractual instruments only if such instruments exist and information about them\ninforms users’ understanding of an entity’s Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB31 Contractual instruments are any type of contract between an entity and another party for the sale and purchase\nof energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims\n(unbundled energy attribute claims relate to the sale and purchase of energy that is separate and distinct from\nthe greenhouse gas attribute contractual instruments). Various types of contractual instruments are available\nin different markets and the entity might disclose information about its market-based Scope 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions as part of its disclosure.\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nB32 In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), an entity shall disclose information about its Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the source of these emissions. The\nentity shall consider its entire value chain (upstream and downstream) and shall consider all 15 categories of\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, as described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain\nAASB S2 22 APPENDIX B\n\n(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011). In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), the entity shall\ndisclose which of these categories are included in its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.\nB33 For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the method an entity uses to measure its greenhouse gas emissions,\nthe entity is required to disclose the categories included within its measure of Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions as described in paragraph 29(a)(vi)(1).\nB34 On the occurrence of a significant event or a significant change in circumstances, an entity shall reassess the\nscope of all affected climate-related risks and opportunities throughout its value chain, including reassessing\nwhich Scope 3 categories and entities throughout its value chain to include in the measurement of its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. A significant event or significant change in circumstances can occur without the\nentity being involved in that event or change in circumstances or as a result of a change in what the entity\nassesses to be important to users of general purpose financial reports. For example, such significant events or\nsignificant changes in circumstances might include:\n(a) a significant change in the entity's value chain (for example, a supplier in the entity's value chain\nmakes a change that significantly alters the supplier’s greenhouse gas emissions);\n(b) a significant change in the entity’s business model, activities or corporate structure (for example, a\nmerger or acquisition that expands the entity's value chain); and\n(c) a significant change in the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (for example,\na supplier in the entity’s value chain is affected by the introduction of an emissions regulation that\nthe entity had not anticipated).\nB35 An entity is permitted, but not required, to reassess the scope of any climate-related risk or opportunity\nthroughout its value chain more frequently than required by paragraph B34.\nB36 To determine the scope of the value chain, which includes its breadth and composition, an entity shall use all\nreasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost\nor effort.\nB37 An entity that participates in one or more financial activities associated with asset management, commercial\nbanking and insurance shall disclose additional information about the financed emissions associated with those\nactivities as part of the entity’s disclosure of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraphs B58–\nAusB63.1).\nScope 3 measurement framework\nB38 An entity’s measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is likely to include the use of estimation rather\nthan solely comprising direct measurement. In measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions an entity shall\nuse a measurement approach, inputs and assumptions that result in a faithful representation of this\nmeasurement. The measurement framework described in paragraphs B40–B54 provides guidance for an entity\nto use in preparing its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.\nB39 An entity is required to use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the\nreporting date without undue cost or effort when the entity selects the measurement approach, inputs and\nassumptions it uses in measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB40 An entity’s measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions relies upon a range of inputs. This Standard\ndoes not specify the inputs the entity is required to use to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, but\ndoes require the entity to prioritise inputs and assumptions using these identifying characteristics (which are\nlisted in no particular order):\n(a) data based on direct measurement (paragraphs B43–B45);\n(b) data from specific activities within the entity’s value chain (paragraphs B46–B49);\n(c) timely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the technology used for, the value chain\nactivity and its greenhouse gas emissions (paragraphs B50–B52); and\n(d) data that has been verified (paragraphs B53–B54).\nB41 An entity is required to apply the Scope 3 measurement framework to prioritise inputs and assumptions even\nwhen the entity is required by a jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which the entity is listed to use a\nmethod other than the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) for\nmeasuring its greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraphs B24–B25), or whether the entity uses the transition\nrelief described in paragraph C4(a).\nB42 An entity’s prioritisation of the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions and the entity’s considerations\nof associated trade-offs—based on the characteristics in paragraph B40—requires management to apply\njudgement. For example, an entity might need to consider the trade-offs between timely data and data that is\nAASB S2 23 APPENDIX B\n\nmore representative of the jurisdiction and technology used for the value chain activity and its emissions. More\nrecent data might provide less detail about the specific activity, including the technology that was used in the\nvalue chain and the location of that activity. On the other hand, older data that is published infrequently might\nbe considered more representative of the specific activity and its greenhouse gas emissions.\nData based on direct measurement\nB43 Two methods are used to quantify Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions: direct measurement and estimation. Of\nthese two methods—and with all else being equal—an entity shall prioritise direct measurement.\nB44 ‘Direct measurement’ refers to the direct monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions and, in theory, provides the\nmost accurate evidence. However, it is expected that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data will include\nestimation due to the challenges associated with direct measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB45 Estimation of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions involves approximate calculations of data based on\nassumptions and appropriate inputs. An entity that measures its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions using\nestimation is likely to use two types of input:\n(a) data that represents the entity’s activity that results in greenhouse gas emissions (activity data). For\nexample, the entity might use distance travelled as activity data to represent the transport of goods\nwithin its value chain.\n(b) emission factors that convert activity data into greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the entity\nwill convert the distance travelled (activity data) into greenhouse gas emissions data using emission\nfactors.\nData from specific activities within the entity’s value chain\nB46 An entity’s measurement of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will be based on data obtained directly from\nspecific activities within the entity’s value chain (primary data), data not obtained directly from activities\nwithin the entity’s value chain (secondary data), or a combination of both.\nB47 In measuring an entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, primary data is more likely to be representative\nof the entity’s value chain activity and its greenhouse gas emissions than secondary data. Therefore, the entity\nshall prioritise—with all else being equal—the use of primary data.\nB48 Primary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions includes data provided by suppliers or other entities in the\nvalue chain related to specific activities in an entity’s value chain. For example, primary data could be sourced\nfrom meter readings, utility bills or other methods that represent specific activities in the entity’s value chain.\nPrimary data could be collected internally (for example, through the entity’s own records), or externally from\nsuppliers and other value chain partners (for example, supplier-specific emission factors for purchased goods\nor services). Data from specific activities within an entity’s value chain provides a more accurate\nrepresentation of the entity’s specific value chain activities and, therefore, will provide a better basis for\nmeasuring the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB49 Secondary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is data that is not obtained directly from specific\nactivities within an entity’s value chain. Secondary data is often supplied by third-party data providers and\nincludes industry-average data (for example, from published databases, government statistics, literature\nstudies and industry associations). Secondary data includes data used to approximate the activity or emission\nfactors. Additionally, secondary data includes primary data from a specific activity (proxy data) used to\nestimate greenhouse gas emissions for another activity. If an entity uses secondary data to measure its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions, it shall consider the extent to which the data faithfully represents the entity’s\nactivities.\nTimely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the technology used for,\nthe value chain activity and its greenhouse gas emissions\nB50 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise the use of activity or emissions data that is based on, or\nrepresents, the technology used in the value chain activity the data is intended to represent. For example, an\nentity might obtain primary data from its activities (for example, the specific aircraft model, distance travelled\nand travel-class used by employees when travelling) and would then use secondary data that represents the\ngreenhouse gas emissions arising from those activities to convert the primary data into an estimate of its\ngreenhouse gas emissions from air travel.\nB51 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data that is based on, or represents, the\njurisdiction in which the activity happened. For example, an entity shall prioritise emission factors that relate\nto the jurisdiction in which the entity operates or in which the activity has taken place.\nAASB S2 24 APPENDIX B\n\nB52 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data that is timely and representative\nof the entity’s value chain activity during the reporting period. In some jurisdictions, and for some\ntechnologies, secondary data is collected annually and, therefore, the data is likely to be representative of the\nentity’s current practice. However, some secondary data sources rely on information collected in a reporting\nperiod that is different from the entity’s own reporting period.\nVerified data\nB53 An entity shall prioritise Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data that is verified. Verification can provide users\nof general purpose financial reports with confidence that the information is complete, neutral and accurate.\nB54 Verified data might include data that has been internally or externally verified. Verification can take place in\nseveral ways, including on-site checking, reviewing calculations, or cross-checking of data against other\nsources. However, in some cases an entity might be unable to verify its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nwithout undue cost or effort. For example, the entity might be prevented from obtaining a complete set of\nverified data due to the volume of data or because the data is obtained from entities in the value chain that are\nseparated by many tiers from the reporting entity, that is, entities that the reporting entity does not interact\nwith directly. In such cases, an entity might need to use unverified data.\nDisclosure of inputs to Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nB55 An entity shall disclose information about the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it uses to\nmeasure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii). This disclosure shall\ninclude information about the characteristics of the data inputs as described in paragraph B40. The purpose of\nthis disclosure is to provide users of general purpose financial reports with information about how the entity\nhas prioritised the highest quality data available, which faithfully represents the value chain activity and its\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. This disclosure also helps users of general purpose financial reports to\nunderstand why the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions the entity uses to estimate its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions are relevant.\nB56 As part of the requirement in paragraph 29(a)(iii), and to reflect how an entity prioritises Scope 3 data in\naccordance with the measurement framework set out in paragraphs B40–B54, the entity shall disclose\ninformation that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand:\n(a) the extent to which the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are measured using inputs from\nspecific activities within the entity’s value chain; and\n(b) the extent to which the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are measured using inputs that\nare verified.\nB57 This Standard includes the presumption that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions can be estimated reliably using\nsecondary data and industry averages. In those rare cases when an entity determines it is impracticable to\nestimate its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, the entity shall disclose how it is managing its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Applying a requirement is impracticable when the entity cannot apply it after\nmaking every reasonable effort to do so.\nFinanced emissions\nB58 Entities participating in financial activities face risks and opportunities related to the greenhouse gas emissions\nassociated with those activities. Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher greenhouse gas emissions\nmight be susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy\nchange, which in turn can affect the financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities.\nThese risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other\nfinancial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by\nincreasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise\nthrough technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects. Entities\nparticipating in financial activities, including commercial and investment banks, asset managers and insurance\nentities, are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This\nmeasurement serves as an indicator of an entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how\nthe entity might need to adapt its financial activities over time.\nB59 Paragraph 29 (a)(i)(3) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\ngenerated during the reporting period, including upstream and downstream emissions. An entity that\nparticipates in one or more of the following financial activities is required to disclose additional and specific\ninformation about its Category 15 emissions or those emissions associated with its investments which is also\nknown as ‘financed emissions’:\nAASB S2 25 APPENDIX B\n\n(a) asset management (see paragraph B61);\n(b) commercial banking (see paragraph B62); and\n(c) insurance (see paragraph B63).\nB60 An entity shall apply the requirements for disclosing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with\nparagraph 29(a) when disclosing information about its financed emissions.\nAsset management\nB61 An entity that participates in asset management activities shall disclose:\n(a) its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions.\n(b) for each of the disaggregated items in paragraph B61(a), the total amount of assets under\nmanagement (AUM) that is included in the financed emissions disclosure, expressed in the\npresentation currency of the entity’s financial statements.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s total AUM included in the financed emissions calculation. If the\npercentage is less than 100%, the entity shall disclose information that explains the exclusions,\nincluding types of assets and associated amount of AUM.\n(d) the methodology used to calculate the financed emissions, including the method of allocation the\nentity used to attribute its share of emissions in relation to the size of investments.\nCommercial banking\nB62 An entity that participates in commercial banking activities shall disclose:\n(a) its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions for each industry by asset class. When disaggregating by:\n(i) industry—the entity shall use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) 6-digit\nindustry-level code for classifying counterparties, reflecting the latest version of the\nclassification system available at the reporting date.\n(ii) asset class—the disclosure shall include loans, project finance, bonds, equity investments\nand undrawn loan commitments. If the entity calculates and discloses financed emissions\nfor other asset classes, it shall include an explanation of why the inclusion of those\nadditional asset classes provides relevant information to users of general purpose\nfinancial reports.\n(b) its gross exposure to each industry by asset class, expressed in the presentation currency of the\nentity’s financial statements. For:\n(i) funded amounts—gross exposure shall be calculated as the funded carrying amounts\n(before subtracting the loss allowance, when applicable), whether prepared in accordance\nwith Australian Accounting Standards or other GAAP.\n(ii) undrawn loan commitments—the entity shall disclose the full amount of the commitment\nseparately from the drawn portion of loan commitments.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions calculation. The\nentity shall:\n(i) if the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions\ncalculation is less than 100%, disclose information that explains the exclusions, including\nthe type of assets excluded.\n(ii) for funded amounts, exclude from gross exposure all impacts of risk mitigants, if\napplicable.\n(iii) disclose separately the percentage of its undrawn loan commitments included in the\nfinanced emissions calculation.\n(d) the methodology the entity used to calculate its financed emissions, including the method of\nallocation the entity used to attribute its share of emissions in relation to the size of its gross\nexposure.\nAASB S2 26 APPENDIX B\n\nInsurance\nB63 An entity that participates in financial activities associated with the insurance industry shall disclose:\n(a) its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions for each industry by asset class. When disaggregating by:\n(i) industry—the entity shall use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) 6-digit\nindustry-level code for classifying counterparties, reflecting the latest version of the\nclassification system available at the reporting date.\n(ii) asset class—the disclosure shall include loans, bonds and equity investments, as well as\nundrawn loan commitments. If the entity calculates and discloses financed emissions for\nother asset classes, it shall include an explanation of why the inclusion of those additional\nasset classes provides relevant information to users of general purpose financial reports.\n(b) the gross exposure for each industry by asset class, expressed in the presentation currency of the\nentity’s financial statements. For:\n(i) funded amounts—gross exposure shall be calculated as the funded carrying amounts\n(before subtracting the loss allowance, when applicable), whether prepared in accordance\nwith Australian Accounting Standards or other GAAP.\n(ii) undrawn loan commitments—the entity shall disclose the full amount of the commitment\nseparately from the drawn portion of loan commitments.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions calculation. The\nentity shall:\n(i) if the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed emissions\ncalculation is less than 100%, disclose information that explains the exclusions, including\ntype of assets excluded.\n(ii) disclose separately the percentage of its undrawn loan commitments included in the\nfinanced emissions calculation.\n(d) the methodology the entity used to calculate its financed emissions, including the method of\nallocation the entity used to attribute its share of emissions in relation to the size of its gross\nexposure.\nAusB63.1 For the purposes of paragraphs B62(a)(i) and B63(a)(i), the latest version of the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS) available at the reporting date means the version that incorporates\namendments to August 2024.\nCross-industry metric categories (paragraph 29(b)–(g))\nB64 In addition to information about an entity’s greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is required to disclose\ninformation relevant to the cross-industry metric categories set out in paragraph 29(b)–(g).\nB65 In preparing disclosures to fulfil the requirements in paragraph 29(b)–(g), an entity shall:\n(a) consider the time horizons over which the effects of climate-related risks and opportunities could\nreasonably be expected to occur, described in accordance with paragraph 10.\n(b) consider where in the entity’s business model and value chain climate-related risks and\nopportunities are concentrated (for example, geographical areas, facilities or types of assets) (see\nparagraph 13).\n(c) consider the information disclosed in accordance with paragraph 16(a)–(b) in relation to the effects\nof climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s financial position, financial performance\nand cash flows for the reporting period.\n(d) [deleted by the AASB]\n(e) consider the connections between the information disclosed to fulfil the requirements in\nparagraph 29(b)–(g) with the information disclosed in the related financial statements, in\naccordance with paragraph 21(b)(ii) of Appendix D. These connections include consistency in the\ndata and assumptions used—to the extent possible—and linkages between the amounts disclosed in\naccordance with paragraph 29(b)–(g) and the amounts recognised and disclosed in the financial\nstatements. For example, an entity would consider whether the carrying amount of assets used is\nAASB S2 27 APPENDIX B\n\nconsistent with amounts included in the financial statements and would explain the connections\nbetween information in these disclosures and amounts in the financial statements.\nClimate-related targets (paragraphs 33–Aus37.1)\nCharacteristics of a climate-related target\nB66 Paragraph 33 requires an entity to disclose the quantitative or qualitative climate-related targets it has set, and\nany it is required to meet by law or regulation, including any greenhouse gas emissions targets. In disclosing\nthese climate-related targets, the entity is required to disclose information about the characteristics of these\ntargets as described in paragraph 33(a)–(h). If the climate-related target is quantitative, an entity is required to\ndescribe whether the target is an absolute target or an intensity target. An absolute target is defined as a total\namount of a measure or a change in the total amount of a measure, whereas an intensity target is defined as a\nratio of a measure, or a change in the ratio of a measure, to a business metric.\nB67 [Deleted by the AASB]\nAusB67.1 In identifying and disclosing the metric used to set a climate-related target and measure progress,\nan entity shall consider the cross-industry metrics. If the metric has been developed by the entity to\nmeasure progress towards a target, the entity shall disclose information about that metric in\naccordance with paragraph 50 of Appendix D.\nGreenhouse gas emissions targets\nGross and net greenhouse gas emissions targets\nB68 If an entity has a greenhouse gas emissions target, the entity is required to specify whether the target is a gross\ngreenhouse gas emissions target or a net greenhouse gas emissions target. Gross greenhouse gas emissions\ntargets reflect the total changes in greenhouse gas emissions planned within the entity’s value chain. Net\ngreenhouse gas emissions targets are the entity’s targeted gross greenhouse gas emissions minus any planned\noffsetting efforts (for example, the entity’s planned use of carbon credits to offset its greenhouse gas\nemissions).\nB69 Paragraph 36(c) specifies that if an entity has a net greenhouse gas emissions target it is required to also\ndisclose a gross greenhouse gas emissions target. For the avoidance of doubt, if the entity discloses a net\ngreenhouse gas emissions target, this target cannot obscure information about its gross greenhouse gas\nemissions targets.\nCarbon credits\nB70 Paragraph 36(e) requires an entity to describe its planned use of carbon credits—which are transferable or\ntradeable instruments—to offset emissions to achieve any net greenhouse gas emissions targets the entity has\nset, or any it is required to meet by law or regulation. Any information about the planned use of carbon credits\nshall clearly demonstrate the extent to which these carbon credits are relied on to achieve the net greenhouse\ngas emissions targets.\nB71 In accordance with paragraph 36(e), an entity is required to disclose only its planned use of carbon credits.\nHowever, as part of this disclosure, the entity might also include information about carbon credits it has already\npurchased that the entity is planning to use to meet its net greenhouse gas emissions target, if the information\nenables users of general purpose financial reports to understand the entity’s greenhouse gas emissions target.\nAASB S2 28 APPENDIX B\n\nAppendix C\nEffective date and transition\nThis appendix is an integral part of AASB S2 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.\nEffective date\nC1 [Deleted by the AASB]\nAusC1.1 An entity shall apply this Standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2025. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that\nfact.\nC2 For the purposes of applying paragraphs C3–C5, the date of initial application is the beginning of the annual\nreporting period in which an entity first applies this Standard.\nTransition\nC3 An entity is not required to provide the disclosures specified in this Standard for any period before the date of\ninitial application. Accordingly, an entity is not required to disclose comparative information in the first annual\nreporting period in which it applies this Standard.\nC4 In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard, the entity is permitted to use one\nor both of these reliefs:\n(a) if, in the annual reporting period immediately preceding the date of initial application of this\nStandard, the entity used a method for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions other than the\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004), the entity is\npermitted to continue using that other method; and\n(b) an entity is not required to disclose its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraph 29(a))\nwhich includes, if the entity participates in asset management, commercial banking or insurance\nactivities, the additional information about its financed emissions (see paragraph 29(a)(vi)(2) and\nparagraphs B58–AusB63.1).\nC5 If an entity uses the relief in paragraph C4(a) or paragraph C4(b), the entity is permitted to continue to use\nthat relief for the purposes of presenting that information as comparative information in subsequent reporting\nperiods.\nAASB S2 29 APPENDIX C\n\nAppendix D\nGeneral requirements for disclosure of climate-related financial\ninformation\nThis appendix is an integral part of AASB S2 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.\nThis appendix prescribes how an entity prepares and reports its climate-related financial disclosures. It sets out\ngeneral requirements for the presentation of those disclosures, guidelines for their structure and requirements\nfor their content.\nThe appendix contains paragraphs drawn from the voluntary Standard AASB S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (September 2024). However, the requirements in this\nappendix apply only to climate-related financial information, and not to the broader sustainability-related\nfinancial information covered by AASB S1.\nEntities are required to comply with all of the requirements in this appendix, as well as the other requirements\nof AASB S2, in order for an entity to be able to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with\nAASB S2.\nAn entity applying AASB S2 is not required to apply AASB S1. Rather, an entity applying AASB S2 is required\nto comply only with AASB S2, including this appendix. The entity does not need to consider AASB S1 or the\nparagraphs of AASB S1 that are not included in this appendix. However, the entity may refer to AASB S1 for\nguidance in complying with the requirements in this appendix.\nApplying both mandatory AASB S2 and voluntary AASB S1\nTo assist entities that elect to apply AASB S1 as well as AASB S2:\n• the paragraph numbering in this appendix uses the numbering of AASB S1, including paragraphs\nfrom its Appendices B and D;\n• paragraphs of AASB S1 that are not included in this appendix are noted; and\n• the AASB clarified that the requirements set out in paragraphs 7 and 26 apply particularly if an entity\nelects to apply AASB S1 to disclose information about other sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities in addition to climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs Aus7.1 and\nAus26.1 in the body of AASB S2). The paragraphs require an entity to avoid unnecessary duplication\nof governance and risk management disclosures by providing integrated disclosures instead of\nseparate disclosures for each sustainability-related risk and opportunity, if oversight of sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities is managed on an integrated basis.\nAll paragraph cross-references in this appendix are to paragraphs in this appendix.\nThe only changes to the text of the AASB S1 paragraphs as included in this appendix are to limit the scope to\nclimate-related financial information (instead of sustainability-related financial information), to refer to Australian\npronouncements and to remove cross-references to paragraphs that are not included in this appendix.\n1–9 [Not included]\nConceptual foundations\n10 For climate-related financial information to be useful, it must be relevant and faithfully represent what\nit purports to represent. These are fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful climate-related\nfinancial information. The usefulness of climate-related financial information is enhanced if the\ninformation is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable. These are enhancing qualitative\ncharacteristics of useful climate-related financial information (see Appendix D).\nFair presentation\n11 A complete set of climate-related financial disclosures shall present fairly all climate-related risks and\nopportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s prospects.\n12 To identify climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s\nprospects, an entity shall apply paragraphs B8–B10.\nAASB S2 30 APPENDIX D\n\n13 Fair presentation requires disclosure of relevant information about climate-related risks and\nopportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects, and their faithful\nrepresentation in accordance with the principles set out in this Standard. To achieve faithful\nrepresentation, an entity shall provide a complete, neutral and accurate depiction of those climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities.\n14 Materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude, or both, of the items to\nwhich the information relates, in the context of the entity’s climate-related financial disclosures.\n15 Fair presentation also requires an entity:\n(a) to disclose information that is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable; and\n(b) to disclose additional information if compliance with the specifically applicable requirements in\nAustralian Sustainability Reporting Standards is insufficient to enable users of general purpose\nfinancial reports to understand the effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s\ncash flows, its access to finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long term.\n16 Applying Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards, with additional information disclosed when\nnecessary (see paragraph 15(b)), is presumed to result in climate-related financial disclosures that achieve fair\npresentation.\nMateriality\n17 An entity shall disclose material information about the climate-related risks and opportunities that\ncould reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects.\n18 In the context of climate-related financial disclosures, information is material if omitting, misstating or\nobscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that primary users of\ngeneral purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports, which include financial statements\nand climate-related financial disclosures and which provide information about a specific reporting\nentity.\n19 To identify and disclose material information, an entity shall apply paragraphs B13–B19 and B21–B37.\nReporting entity\n20 [Not included]\nAus20.1 An entity’s climate-related financial disclosures shall be for the same reporting entity as the\nrelated financial statements, unless otherwise permitted by law (see paragraph AusB38.1).\nConnected information\n21 An entity shall provide information in a manner that enables users of general purpose financial reports\nto understand the following types of connections:\n(a) the connections between the items to which the information relates—such as connections\nbetween various climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to\naffect the entity’s prospects; and\n(b) the connections between disclosures provided by the entity:\n(i) within its climate-related financial disclosures—such as connections between\ndisclosures on governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets; and\n(ii) across its climate-related financial disclosures and other general purpose financial\nreports published by the entity—such as its related financial statements (see\nparagraphs B39–B44).\n22 An entity shall identify the financial statements to which the climate-related financial disclosures relate.\n23 Data and assumptions used in preparing the climate-related financial disclosures shall be consistent—\nto the extent possible considering the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards—with the\ncorresponding data and assumptions used in preparing the related financial statements (see paragraph\nB42).\n24 When currency is specified as the unit of measure in the climate-related financial disclosures, the entity\nshall use the presentation currency of its related financial statements.\nAASB S2 31 APPENDIX D\n\nCore content\n25–\n27 [Not included]\nStrategy\n28–\n30 [Not included]\n31 Short-, medium- and long-term time horizons can vary between entities and depend on many factors, including\nindustry-specific characteristics, such as cash flow, investment and business cycles, the planning horizons\ntypically used in an entity’s industry for strategic decision-making and capital allocation plans, and the time\nhorizons over which users of general purpose financial reports conduct their assessments of entities in that\nindustry.\n32–\n44 [Not included]\nMetrics and targets\n45–\n48 [Not included]\n49 If an entity discloses a metric taken from a source other than Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards,\nthe entity shall identify the source and the metric taken.\n50 If a metric has been developed by an entity, the entity shall disclose information about:\n(a) how the metric is defined, including whether it is derived by adjusting a metric taken from a source\nother than Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards and, if so, which source and how the metric\ndisclosed by the entity differs from the metric specified in that source;\n(b) whether the metric is an absolute measure, a measure expressed in relation to another metric or a\nqualitative measure (such as a red, amber, green—or RAG—status);\n(c) whether the metric is validated by a third party and, if so, which party; and\n(d) the method used to calculate the metric and the inputs to the calculation, including the limitations\nof the method used and the significant assumptions made.\n51 [Not included]\n52 The definition and calculation of metrics, including metrics used to set the entity’s targets and monitor\nprogress towards reaching them, shall be consistent over time. If a metric is redefined or replaced, an entity\nshall apply paragraph B52.\n53 An entity shall label and define metrics and targets using meaningful, clear and precise names and descriptions.\nGeneral requirements\n54–\n59 [Not included]\nLocation of disclosures\n60 An entity is required to provide disclosures required by Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards\nas part of its general purpose financial reports.\n61 [Not included]\n62 An entity may disclose information required by an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard in the same\nlocation as information disclosed to meet other requirements, such as information required by regulators. The\nentity shall ensure that the climate-related financial disclosures are clearly identifiable and not obscured by\nthat additional information (see paragraph B27).\n63 Information required by an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard may be included in climate-related\nfinancial disclosures by cross-reference to another report published by the entity. If an entity includes\ninformation by cross-reference, the entity shall apply the requirements in paragraphs B45–B47.\nAASB S2 32 APPENDIX D\n\nTiming of reporting\n64 An entity shall report its climate-related financial disclosures at the same time as its related financial\nstatements. The entity’s climate-related financial disclosures shall cover the same reporting period as\nthe related financial statements.\n65 Normally, an entity prepares climate-related financial disclosures for a 12-month period. However, for\npractical reasons, some entities prefer to report, for example, for a 52-week period. This Standard does not\npreclude that practice.\n66 When an entity changes the end of its reporting period and provides climate-related financial disclosures for\na period longer or shorter than 12 months, it shall disclose:\n(a) the period covered by the climate-related financial disclosures;\n(b) the reason for using a longer or shorter period; and\n(c) the fact that the amounts disclosed in the climate-related financial disclosures are not entirely\ncomparable.\n67 If, after the end of the reporting period but before the date on which the climate-related financial disclosures\nare authorised for issue, an entity receives information about conditions that existed at the end of the reporting\nperiod, it shall update disclosures that relate to those conditions in the light of the new information.\n68 An entity shall disclose information about transactions, other events and conditions that occur after the end of\nthe reporting period, but before the date on which the climate-related financial disclosures are authorised for\nissue, if non-disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that primary\nusers of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports.\n69 This Standard does not mandate which entities would be required to provide interim climate-related financial\ndisclosures, how frequently, or how soon after the end of an interim period. However, governments, securities\nregulators, stock exchanges and accountancy bodies may require entities whose debt or equity securities are\npublicly traded to publish interim general purpose financial reports. If an entity is required or elects to publish\ninterim climate-related financial disclosures in accordance with Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards,\nthe entity shall apply paragraph B48.\nComparative information\n70 Unless another Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard permits or requires otherwise, an entity\nshall disclose comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts disclosed in\nthe reporting period. If such information would be useful for an understanding of the climate-related\nfinancial disclosures for the reporting period, the entity shall also disclose comparative information for\nnarrative and descriptive climate-related financial information (see paragraphs B49–B59).\n71 [Not included]\nStatement of compliance\n72 An entity whose climate-related financial disclosures comply with all the requirements of this\nAustralian Sustainability Reporting Standard shall make an explicit and unreserved statement of\ncompliance. An entity shall not describe climate-related financial disclosures as complying with this\nStandard unless they comply with all the requirements of this Standard.\n73 This Standard relieves an entity from disclosing information otherwise required by an Australian\nSustainability Reporting Standard if law or regulation prohibits the entity from disclosing that information\n(see paragraph B33). This Standard also relieves an entity from disclosing information about a climate-related\nopportunity otherwise required by an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard if that information is\ncommercially sensitive as described in this Standard (see paragraphs B34–B37). An entity using these\nexemptions is not prevented from asserting compliance with Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards.\nJudgements, uncertainties and errors\nJudgements\n74 An entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand\nthe judgements, apart from those involving estimations of amounts (see paragraph 77), that the entity\nAASB S2 33 APPENDIX D\n\nhas made in the process of preparing its climate-related financial disclosures and that have the most\nsignificant effect on the information included in those disclosures.\n75 In the process of preparing climate-related financial disclosures, an entity makes various judgements, apart\nfrom those involving estimations, that can significantly affect the information reported in the entity’s climate-\nrelated financial disclosures. For example, an entity makes judgements in:\n(a) identifying climate-related risks and opportunities that could be reasonably expected to affect the\nentity’s prospects;\n(b) determining which sources of guidance to apply;\n(c) identifying material information to include in the climate-related financial disclosures; and\n(d) assessing whether an event or change in circumstances is significant and requires reassessment of\nthe scope of all affected climate-related risks and opportunities throughout the entity’s value chain.\n76 [Not included]\nMeasurement uncertainty\n77 An entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand\nthe most significant uncertainties affecting the amounts reported in its climate-related financial\ndisclosures.\n78 An entity shall:\n(a) identify the amounts that it has disclosed that are subject to a high level of measurement\nuncertainty; and\n(b) in relation to each amount identified in paragraph 78(a), disclose information about:\n(i) the sources of measurement uncertainty—for example, the dependence of the\namount on the outcome of a future event, on a measurement technique or on the\navailability and quality of data from the entity’s value chain; and\n(ii) the assumptions, approximations and judgements the entity has made in measuring\nthe amount.\n79 When amounts reported in climate-related financial disclosures cannot be measured directly and can only be\nestimated, measurement uncertainty arises. In some cases, an estimate involves assumptions about possible\nfuture events with uncertain outcomes. The use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of preparing\nclimate-related financial disclosures and does not undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates\nare accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty would not necessarily\nprevent such an estimate from providing useful information.\n80 The requirement in paragraph 77 for an entity to disclose information about the uncertainties affecting the\namounts reported in climate-related financial disclosures relates to the estimates that require the entity’s most\ndifficult, subjective or complex judgements. As the number of variables and assumptions increases, those\njudgements become more subjective and complex, and the uncertainty affecting the amounts reported in the\nclimate-related financial disclosures increases accordingly.\n81 The type and extent of the information an entity might need to disclose vary according to the nature of the\namount reported in the climate-related financial disclosures—the sources of and the factors contributing to the\nuncertainty and other circumstances. Examples of the type of information an entity might need to disclose are:\n(a) the nature of the assumption or other source of measurement uncertainty;\n(b) the sensitivity of the disclosed amount to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying its\ncalculation, including the reasons for the sensitivity;\n(c) the expected resolution of an uncertainty and the range of reasonably possible outcomes for the\ndisclosed amount; and\n(d) an explanation of changes made to past assumptions concerning the disclosed amount, if the\nuncertainty remains unresolved.\n82 [Not included]\nErrors\n83 An entity shall correct material prior period errors by restating the comparative amounts for the prior\nperiod(s) disclosed unless it is impracticable to do so.\nAASB S2 34 APPENDIX D\n\n84 Prior period errors are omissions from and misstatements in the entity’s climate-related financial disclosures\nfor one or more prior periods. Such errors arise from a failure to use, or the misuse of, reliable information\nthat:\n(a) was available when the climate-related financial disclosures for that period(s) were authorised for\nissue; and\n(b) could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and considered in the preparation of those\ndisclosures.\n85 Corrections of errors are distinguished from changes in estimates. Estimates are approximations that an entity\nmight need to revise as additional information becomes known.\n86 If an entity identifies a material error in its prior period climate-related financial disclosures, it shall apply\nparagraphs B55–B59.\nApplication guidance (from AASB S1, Appendix B)\nClimate-related risks and opportunities (paragraphs 11–12)\nB1 This Standard requires an entity to disclose information about all climate-related risks and opportunities that\ncould reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the\nshort, medium or long term (referred to as ‘climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be\nexpected to affect the entity’s prospects’).\nB2 An entity’s climate-related risks and opportunities arise out of the interactions between the entity and its\nstakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment throughout the entity’s value chain. These\ninteractions—which can be direct and indirect—result from operating an entity’s business model in pursuit of\nthe entity’s strategic purposes and from the external environment in which the entity operates. These\ninteractions take place within an interdependent system in which an entity both depends on resources and\nrelationships throughout its value chain to generate cash flows and affects those resources and relationships\nthrough its activities and outputs—contributing to the preservation, regeneration and development of those\nresources and relationships or to their degradation and depletion. These dependencies and impacts might give\nrise to climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s cash\nflows, its access to finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long term.\nB3–\nB7 [Not included]\nReasonable and supportable information\nB8 Reasonable and supportable information used by an entity in preparing its climate-related financial disclosures\nshall cover factors that are specific to the entity as well as general conditions in the external environment. In\nsome cases—such as in identifying climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected\nto affect an entity’s prospects—reasonable and supportable information includes information about past\nevents, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. Other Australian Sustainability Reporting\nStandards may specify what is reasonable and supportable information in specific cases.\nB9 An entity may use various sources of data that may be both internal and external. Possible data sources include\nthe entity’s risk management processes; industry and peer group experience; and external ratings, reports and\nstatistics. Information that is used by the entity in preparing its financial statements, operating its business\nmodel, setting its strategy and managing its risks and opportunities is considered to be available to the entity\nwithout undue cost or effort.\nB10 An entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information to identify climate-related risks and\nopportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects. The assessment of what\nconstitutes undue cost or effort depends on the entity’s specific circumstances and requires a balanced\nconsideration of the costs and efforts for the entity and the benefits of the resulting information for primary\nusers. That assessment can change over time as circumstances change.\nB11–\nB12 [Not included]\nAASB S2 35 APPENDIX D\n\nMateriality (paragraphs 17–19)\nB13 Paragraph 17 requires an entity to disclose material information about the climate-related risks and\nopportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects. Materiality of information is\njudged in relation to whether omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected\nto influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial reports, which provide information about\na specific reporting entity.\nB14 The decisions of primary users relate to providing resources to the entity and involve decisions about:\n(a) buying, selling or holding equity and debt instruments;\n(b) providing or selling loans and other forms of credit; or\n(c) exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise influence, the entity’s management’s actions that affect\nthe use of the entity’s economic resources.\nAusB14.1 In respect of not-for-profit entities, the following are examples of decisions of primary users relating\nto providing resources to an entity:\n(a) parliaments deciding on behalf of constituents whether to fund particular programmes for\ndelivery by an entity;\n(b) taxpayers deciding who should represent them in government;\n(c) donors deciding whether to donate resources to an entity; and\n(d) recipients of goods and services deciding whether they can continue to rely on the\nprovision of goods and services from the entity or whether to seek alternative suppliers.\nB15 The decisions described in paragraph B14 depend on primary users’ expectations about returns, for example,\ndividends, principal and interest payments or market price increases. Those expectations depend on primary\nusers’ assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of future net cash inflows to the entity and on their\nassessment of stewardship of the entity’s economic resources by the entity’s management and its governing\nbody(s) or individual(s).\nAusB15.1 In respect of not-for-profit entities, the decisions described in paragraph AusB14.1 depend on\nprimary users’ expectations about returns and a not-for-profit entity’s ability to continue providing\ngoods or services. Those expectations depend on primary users’ assessment of the amount, timing\nand uncertainty of future net cash inflows to the entity and on their assessment of stewardship of\nthe entity’s economic resources by the entity’s management and its governing body(s) or\nindividual(s).\nB16 Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions made by primary users\nrequires consideration of the characteristics of those users and of the entity’s own circumstances.\nB17 Climate-related financial disclosures are prepared for primary users who have reasonable knowledge of\nbusiness and economic activities and who review and analyse information diligently. At times, even well-\ninformed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand climate-related financial\ninformation.\nB18 Individual primary users may have different, and sometimes even conflicting, information needs and desires.\nInformation needs of primary users may also evolve over time. Climate-related financial disclosures are\nintended to meet common information needs of primary users.\nIdentifying material information\nB19 Materiality judgements are specific to an entity. Consequently, this Standard does not specify any thresholds\nfor materiality or predetermine what would be material in a particular situation.\nB20 [Not included]\nB21 An entity shall assess whether information, either individually or in combination with other information, is\nmaterial in the context of the entity’s climate-related financial disclosures taken as a whole. In assessing\nwhether information is material, an entity shall consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. For example,\nan entity might consider the magnitude and the nature of the effect of a climate-related risk or opportunity on\nthe entity.\nB22 In some cases, Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards require the disclosure of information about\npossible future events with uncertain outcomes. In judging whether information about such possible future\nevents is material, an entity shall consider:\nAASB S2 36 APPENDIX D\n\n(a) the potential effects of the events on the amount, timing and uncertainty of the entity’s future cash\nflows over the short, medium and long term (referred to as ‘the possible outcome’); and\n(b) the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes within that range.\nB23 When considering possible outcomes, an entity shall consider all pertinent facts and circumstances.\nInformation about a possible future event is more likely to be judged as being material if the potential effects\nare significant and the event is likely to occur. However, an entity shall also consider whether information\nabout low-probability and high-impact outcomes might be material either individually or in combination with\ninformation about other low-probability and high-impact outcomes. For example, an entity might be exposed\nto several climate-related risks, each of which could cause the same type of disruption—such as disruption to\nthe entity’s supply chain. Information about an individual source of risk might not be material if disruption\nfrom that source is highly unlikely to occur. However, information about the aggregate risk—the risk of supply\nchain disruption from all sources—might be material.\nB24 If a possible future event is expected to affect an entity’s cash flows, but only many years in the future,\ninformation about that event is usually less likely to be judged material than information about a possible\nfuture event with similar effects that are expected to occur sooner. However, in some circumstances, an item\nof information could reasonably be expected to influence primary users’ decisions regardless of the magnitude\nof the potential effects of the future event or the timing of that event. For example, this might happen if\ninformation about a particular climate-related risk or opportunity is highly scrutinised by primary users of an\nentity’s general purpose financial reports.\nB25 An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard\nif the information is not material. This is the case even if the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard\ncontains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements.\nB26 An entity shall disclose additional information when compliance with the specifically applicable requirements\nin an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard is insufficient to enable users of general purpose financial\nreports to understand the effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on the entity’s cash flows, its access\nto finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long term.\nB27 An entity shall identify its climate-related financial disclosures clearly and distinguish them from other\ninformation provided by the entity (see paragraph 62). An entity shall not obscure material information.\nInformation is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users to\nomitting or misstating that information. Examples of circumstances that might result in material information\nbeing obscured include:\n(a) material information is not clearly distinguished from additional information that is not material;\n(b) material information is disclosed in the climate-related financial disclosures, but the language used\nis vague or unclear;\n(c) material information about a climate-related risk or opportunity is scattered throughout the climate-\nrelated financial disclosures;\n(d) items of information that are dissimilar are inappropriately aggregated;\n(e) items of information that are similar are inappropriately disaggregated; and\n(f) the understandability of the climate-related financial disclosures is reduced as a result of material\ninformation being hidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to\ndetermine what information is material.\nB28 An entity shall reassess its materiality judgements at each reporting date to take account of changed\ncircumstances and assumptions. Because of changes in the entity’s individual circumstances, or in the external\nenvironment, some types of information included in an entity’s climate-related financial disclosures for prior\nperiods might no longer be material. Conversely, some types of information not previously disclosed might\nbecome material.\nAggregation and disaggregation\nB29 When an entity applies Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards, it shall consider all facts and\ncircumstances and decide how to aggregate and disaggregate information in its climate-related financial\ndisclosures. The entity shall not reduce the understandability of its climate-related financial disclosures by\nobscuring material information with immaterial information or by aggregating material items of information\nthat are dissimilar to each other.\nB30 An entity shall not aggregate information if doing so would obscure information that is material. Information\nshall be aggregated if items of information have shared characteristics and shall not be aggregated if they do\nnot have shared characteristics. The entity might need to disaggregate information about climate-related risks\nAASB S2 37 APPENDIX D\n\nand opportunities, for example, by geographical location or in consideration of the geopolitical environment.\nFor example, to ensure that material information is not obscured, an entity might need to disaggregate\ninformation about its use of water to distinguish between water drawn from abundant sources and water drawn\nfrom water-stressed areas.\nInteraction with law or regulation\nB31 Law or regulation might specify requirements for an entity to disclose climate-related information in its\ngeneral purpose financial reports. In such circumstances, the entity is permitted to include in its climate-related\nfinancial disclosures information to meet legal or regulatory requirements, even if that information is not\nmaterial. However, such information shall not obscure material information.\nB32 An entity shall disclose material climate-related financial information, even if law or regulation permits the\nentity not to disclose such information.\nB33 An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard\nif law or regulation prohibits the entity from disclosing that information. If an entity omits material information\nfor that reason, it shall identify the type of information not disclosed and explain the source of the restriction.\nCommercially sensitive information\nB34 If an entity determines that information about a climate-related opportunity is commercially sensitive in the\nlimited circumstances described in paragraph B35, the entity is permitted to omit that information from its\nclimate-related financial disclosures. Such an omission is permitted even if information is otherwise required\nby an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard and the information is material.\nB35 An entity qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph B34 if, and only if:\n(a) information about the climate-related opportunity is not already publicly available;\n(b) disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to prejudice seriously the economic\nbenefits the entity would otherwise be able to realise in pursuing the opportunity; and\n(c) the entity has determined that it is impossible to disclose that information in a manner—for example,\nat an aggregated level—that would enable the entity to meet the objectives of the disclosure\nrequirements without prejudicing seriously the economic benefits the entity would otherwise be\nable to realise in pursuing the opportunity.\nB36 If an entity elects to use the exemption specified in paragraph B34, the entity shall, for each item of information\nomitted:\n(a) disclose the fact that it has used the exemption; and\n(b) reassess, at each reporting date, whether the information qualifies for the exemption.\nB37 An entity is prohibited from using the exemption specified in paragraph B34 in relation to a climate-related\nrisk or as a basis for broad non-disclosure of climate-related financial information.\nReporting entity (paragraph 20)\nB38 [Not included]\nAusB38.1 Unless otherwise permitted by law, paragraph Aus20.1 requires that climate-related financial\ndisclosures shall be for the same reporting entity as the related financial statements. For example,\nconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards\nprovide information about the parent and its subsidiaries as a single reporting entity. Consequently,\nthat entity’s climate-related financial disclosures shall enable users of general purpose financial\nreports to understand the effects of the climate-related risks and opportunities on the cash flows,\naccess to finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long term for the parent and its\nsubsidiaries.\nConnected information (paragraphs 21–24)\nB39 Paragraph 21 requires an entity to provide information in a manner that enables users of general purpose\nfinancial reports to understand connections both between the items to which the information relates and\nbetween disclosures provided by the entity in its general purpose financial reports.\nAASB S2 38 APPENDIX D\n\nB40 Connected information provides insight into connections between the items to which the information relates.\nFor example:\n(a) if an entity pursued a particular climate-related opportunity and that resulted in an increase in the\nentity’s revenue, connected information will depict that relationship between the entity’s strategy\nand its financial performance;\n(b) if an entity identified a trade-off between two climate-related risks it is exposed to and took action\non the basis of its assessment of that trade-off, connected information will depict the relationship\nbetween those risks and the entity’s strategy; and\n(c) if an entity committed to a particular climate-related target, but that commitment has not yet affected\nthe entity’s financial position or financial performance because the applicable recognition criteria\nhave not been met, connected information will depict that relationship.\nB41 Connected information includes:\n(a) connections between various types of information about a particular climate-related risk or\nopportunity, such as:\n(i) between disclosures on governance, strategy and risk management; and\n(ii) between narrative information and quantitative information (including related metrics\nand targets and information in the related financial statements).\n(b) connections between disclosures about various climate-related risks and opportunities. For example,\nif an entity integrates its oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities, the entity shall\nintegrate the disclosures on governance instead of providing separate disclosures on governance for\neach climate-related risk and opportunity.\nB42 Drawing connections between disclosures involves, but is not limited to, providing necessary explanations\nand cross-references and using consistent data, assumptions, and units of measure. In providing connected\ninformation, an entity shall:\n(a) explain connections between disclosures in a clear and concise manner;\n(b) avoid unnecessary duplication if Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards require the\ndisclosure of common items of information; and\n(c) disclose information about significant differences between the data and assumptions used in\npreparing the entity’s climate-related financial disclosures and the data and assumptions used in\npreparing the related financial statements.\nB43 For example, in providing connected information an entity might need to explain the effect or likely effect of\nits strategy on its financial statements and financial planning, or explain how that strategy relates to the metrics\nthe entity uses to measure progress against targets. Another entity might need to explain how its use of natural\nresources or changes within its supply chain could amplify or, in contrast, reduce its climate-related risks and\nopportunities. The entity might need to link the information about its use of natural resources or changes\nwithin its supply chain to information about current or anticipated financial effects on the entity’s production\ncosts, its strategic response to mitigate those risks and its related investment in new assets. The entity might\nneed to link narrative information to the related metrics and targets and to information in the related financial\nstatements.\nB44 Other examples of connected information include:\n(a) an explanation of the combined effects of the entity’s climate-related risks and opportunities and its\nstrategy on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium and\nlong term. For example, an entity might face decreasing demand for its products because of\nconsumer preferences for lower-carbon alternatives. The entity might need to explain how its\nstrategic response, such as closing a major factory, could affect its workforce and local\ncommunities, and the effect of such a closure on the useful lives of its assets and on impairment\nassessments.\n(b) a description of the alternatives that an entity evaluated in setting its strategy in response to its\nclimate-related risks and opportunities, including a description of the trade-offs between those risks\nand opportunities that the entity considered. For example, an entity might need to explain the\npotential effects of its decision to restructure its operations in response to a climate-related risk on\nthe future size and composition of the entity’s workforce.\nAASB S2 39 APPENDIX D\n\nInformation included by cross-reference (paragraph 63)\nB45 Information required by an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard might be available in another report\npublished by the entity. For example, the required information could be disclosed in the related financial\nstatements. Material information can be included in an entity’s climate-related financial disclosures by cross-\nreference, provided that:\n(a) the cross-referenced information is available on the same terms and at the same time as the climate-\nrelated financial disclosures; and\n(b) the complete set of climate-related financial disclosures is not made less understandable by\nincluding information by cross-reference.\nB46 Information included by cross-reference becomes part of the complete set of climate-related financial\ndisclosures and shall comply with the requirements of Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards. For\nexample, it needs to be relevant, representationally faithful, comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.\nThe body(s) or individual(s) that authorises the general purpose financial reports takes the same responsibility\nfor the information included by cross-reference as it does for the information included directly.\nB47 If information required by an Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard is included by cross-reference:\n(a) the climate-related financial disclosures shall clearly identify the report within which that\ninformation is located and explain how to access that report; and\n(b) the cross-reference shall be to a precisely specified part of that report.\nInterim reporting (paragraph 69)\nB48 In the interest of timeliness and cost considerations, and to avoid repetition of information previously reported,\nan entity may be required or choose to provide less information at interim dates than it provides in its annual\nclimate-related financial disclosures. Interim climate-related financial disclosures are intended to provide an\nupdate on the latest complete set of annual disclosures of climate-related financial information. These\ndisclosures focus on new information, events and circumstances and do not duplicate information previously\nreported. Although the information provided in interim climate-related financial disclosures may be more\ncondensed than in annual climate-related financial disclosures, an entity is not prohibited or discouraged from\npublishing a complete set of climate-related financial disclosures as specified in this Standard as part of its\ninterim general purpose financial report.\nComparative information (paragraphs 52, 70 and 83–86)\nB49 Paragraph 70 requires an entity to disclose comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all\namounts disclosed in the reporting period.\nMetrics\nB50 In some cases, the amount disclosed for a metric is an estimate. Except as specified in paragraph B51, if an\nentity identifies new information in relation to the estimated amount disclosed in the preceding period and the\nnew information provides evidence of circumstances that existed in that period, the entity shall:\n(a) disclose a revised comparative amount that reflects that new information;\n(b) disclose the difference between the amount disclosed in the preceding period and the revised\ncomparative amount; and\n(c) explain the reasons for revising the comparative amount.\nB51 In applying the requirement in paragraph B50, an entity need not disclose a revised comparative amount:\n(a) if it is impracticable to do so (see paragraph B54).\n(b) if the metric is forward-looking. Forward-looking metrics relate to possible future transactions,\nevents and other conditions. The entity is permitted to revise a comparative amount for a forward-\nlooking metric if doing so does not involve the use of hindsight.\nB52 If an entity redefines or replaces a metric in the reporting period, the entity shall:\n(a) disclose a revised comparative amount, unless it is impracticable to do so;\n(b) explain the changes; and\nAASB S2 40 APPENDIX D\n\n(c) explain the reasons for those changes, including why the redefined or replacement metric provides\nmore useful information.\nB53 If an entity introduces a new metric in the reporting period, it shall disclose a comparative amount for that\nmetric unless it is impracticable to do so.\nB54 Sometimes, it is impracticable to revise a comparative amount to achieve comparability with the reporting\nperiod. For example, data might not have been collected in the preceding period in a way that allows\nretrospective application of a new definition of a metric, and it might be impracticable to recreate the data. If\nit is impracticable to revise a comparative amount for the preceding period, an entity shall disclose that fact.\nErrors\nB55 Paragraph 83 requires an entity to correct material prior period errors.\nB56 Such errors include: the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying the definitions for metrics or\ntargets, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.\nB57 Potential reporting period errors discovered in that period are corrected before the climate-related financial\ndisclosures are authorised for issue. However, material errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent\nperiod.\nB58 If an entity identifies a material error in its prior period(s) climate-related financial disclosures, it shall\ndisclose:\n(a) the nature of the prior period error;\n(b) the correction, to the extent practicable, for each prior period disclosed; and\n(c) if correction of the error is impracticable, the circumstances that led to the existence of that condition\nand a description of how and from when the error has been corrected.\nB59 When it is impracticable to determine the effect of an error on all prior periods presented, the entity shall\nrestate the comparative information to correct the error from the earliest date practicable.\nQualitative characteristics of useful climate-related financial information\n(from AASB S1, Appendix D)\nIntroduction\nD1 The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as amended to December 2021) and the Framework for\nthe Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (as amended to March 2020) (the Conceptual\nFrameworks) were issued by the AASB. They describe the objective of, and the concepts that apply to, general\npurpose financial reports. One purpose of the Conceptual Frameworks is to assist the AASB to develop\nAustralian Accounting Standards for preparing financial statements based on consistent concepts.\nD2 Climate-related financial disclosures are part of general purpose financial reports. The qualitative\ncharacteristics in the Conceptual Frameworks, therefore, apply to climate-related financial information.\nHowever, the nature of some of the information required to meet the objective of this Standard differs in some\nrespects from the information provided in financial statements.\nD3 Climate-related financial information is useful if it is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to\nrepresent. Relevance and faithful representation are fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful climate-\nrelated financial information. The usefulness of climate-related financial information is enhanced if the\ninformation is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable. Comparability, verifiability, timeliness and\nunderstandability are enhancing characteristics of useful climate-related financial information.\nFundamental qualitative characteristics of useful climate-related\nfinancial information\nRelevance\nD4 Relevant climate-related financial information is capable of making a difference in the decisions made by\nprimary users. Information may be capable of making a difference in a decision even if some users choose not\nAASB S2 41 APPENDIX D\n\nto take advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources. Climate-related financial information is\ncapable of making a difference in decisions made by users if it has predictive value, confirmatory value or\nboth.\nD5 Climate-related financial information has predictive value if it can be used as an input to processes employed\nby primary users to predict future outcomes. Climate-related financial information need not be a prediction or\nforecast to have predictive value. Climate-related financial information with predictive value is employed by\nprimary users in making their own predictions. For example, information about water quality, which can\ninclude information about the water being polluted, could inform the expectations of users about the ability of\nan entity to meet local water-quality requirements.\nD6 Climate-related financial information has confirmatory value if it provides feedback about (confirms or\nchanges) previous evaluations.\nD7 The predictive value and confirmatory value of climate-related financial information are interrelated.\nInformation that has predictive value often also has confirmatory value. For example, information for the\ncurrent year about greenhouse gas emissions, which can be used as the basis for predicting greenhouse gas\nemissions in future years, can also be compared with predictions about greenhouse gas emissions for the\ncurrent year that were made in past years. The results of those comparisons can help a user to correct and\nimprove the processes that were used to make those previous predictions.\nMateriality\nD8 Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to\ninfluence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those\nreports, which provide information about a specific reporting entity. In other words, materiality is an entity-\nspecific aspect of relevance. The materiality of information is assessed in the context of an entity’s climate-\nrelated financial disclosures and is based on the nature or magnitude of the item to which the information\nrelates, or both.\nFaithful representation\nD9 Climate-related financial information represents phenomena in words and numbers. To be useful, the\ninformation must not only represent relevant phenomena, it must also faithfully represent the substance of the\nphenomena that it purports to represent.\nD10 To be a faithful representation, a depiction would be complete, neutral and accurate. The objective of general\npurpose financial reports is to maximise those qualities to the extent possible.\nD11 A complete depiction of a climate-related risk or opportunity includes all material information necessary for\nprimary users to understand that risk or opportunity.\nD12 Climate-related financial information shall be neutral. A neutral depiction is one without bias in the selection\nor disclosure of information. Information is neutral if it is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised\nor otherwise manipulated to make it more likely that primary users will receive that information favourably\nor unfavourably. Neutral information is not information without purpose or without influence on behaviour.\nOn the contrary, relevant information is, by definition, capable of making a difference in users’ decisions.\nD13 Some climate-related financial information—for example, targets or plans—is aspirational. A neutral\ndiscussion of such matters covers both aspirations and the factors that could prevent an entity from achieving\nthese aspirations.\nD14 Neutrality is supported by the exercise of prudence. Prudence is the exercise of caution when making\njudgements under conditions of uncertainty. The exercise of prudence means that opportunities are not\noverstated and risks are not understated. Equally, the exercise of prudence does not allow for the\nunderstatement of opportunities or the overstatement of risks.\nD15 Climate-related financial information shall be accurate. Information can be accurate without being perfectly\nprecise in all respects. The precision needed and attainable, and the factors that make information accurate,\ndepend on the nature of the information and the nature of the matters to which it relates. For example, accuracy\nrequires that:\n(a) factual information is free from material error;\n(b) descriptions are precise;\n(c) estimates, approximations and forecasts are clearly identified as such;\n(d) no material errors are made in selecting and applying an appropriate process for developing an\nestimate, approximation or forecast;\nAASB S2 42 APPENDIX D\n\n(e) assertions and inputs used in developing estimates are reasonable and based on information of\nsufficient quality and quantity; and\n(f) information on judgements about the future faithfully reflects both those judgements and the\ninformation on which they are based.\nEnhancing qualitative characteristics of useful climate-related financial\ninformation\nD16 The usefulness of climate-related financial information is enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely and\nunderstandable.\nComparability\nD17 The decisions made by the primary users of general purpose financial reports involve choosing between\nalternatives; for example, selling or holding an investment, or investing in one reporting entity or another.\nComparability is the characteristic that enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences\namong, items. Unlike the other qualitative characteristics, comparability does not relate to a single item. A\ncomparison requires at least two items. Information is more useful to users if it is also comparable, that is, if\nit can be compared with:\n(a) information provided by the entity in previous periods; and\n(b) information provided by other entities, in particular those with similar activities or operating within\nthe same industry.\nD18 Climate-related financial disclosures shall be provided in a way that enhances comparability.\nD19 Consistency is related to, but is not the same as, comparability. Consistency refers to the use of the same\napproaches or methods for providing disclosures about the same climate-related risks and opportunities, from\nperiod to period, both by a reporting entity and other entities. Comparability is the goal; consistency helps to\nachieve that goal.\nD20 Comparability is not uniformity. For information to be comparable, like things shall look alike and different\nthings shall look different. Comparability of climate-related financial information is not enhanced by making\nunlike things look alike any more than it is enhanced by making like things look different.\nVerifiability\nD21 Verifiability helps to give users confidence that information is complete, neutral and accurate. Information is\nverifiable if it is possible to corroborate either the information itself or the inputs used to derive it. Verifiable\ninformation is more useful to primary users than information that is not verifiable.\nD22 Verifiability means that various knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although\nnot necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful representation. Quantified\ninformation need not be a single point estimate to be verifiable. A range of possible amounts and the related\nprobabilities could also be verified.\nD23 Climate-related financial information shall be provided in a way that enhances its verifiability. Verifiability\ncan be enhanced by, for example:\n(a) including information that can be corroborated by comparing it with other information available to\nprimary users about an entity’s business, about other businesses or about the external environment\nin which the entity operates;\n(b) providing information about inputs and methods of calculation used to produce estimates or\napproximations; and\n(c) providing information reviewed and agreed by the entity’s board, board committees or equivalent\nbodies.\nD24 Some climate-related financial information will be presented as explanations or forward-looking information.\nThat information can be supportable, for example by faithfully representing fact-based strategies, plans and\nrisk analyses. To help primary users decide whether to use such information, an entity shall describe the\nunderlying assumptions and methods of producing the information, as well as other factors that provide\nevidence that the information reflects the actual plans or decisions made by the entity.\nAASB S2 43 APPENDIX D\n\nTimeliness\nD25 Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time to be capable of influencing their\ndecisions. Generally, the older information is, the less useful it is. However, some information may continue\nto be timely long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some users may need to identify\nand assess trends.\nUnderstandability\nD26 Climate-related financial information shall be clear and concise. For climate-related financial disclosures to\nbe concise, they need:\n(a) to avoid generic information, sometimes called ‘boilerplate’, that is not specific to the entity;\n(b) to avoid duplication of information in the general purpose financial reports, including unnecessary\nduplication of information also provided in the related financial statements; and\n(c) to use clear language and clearly structured sentences and paragraphs.\nD27 The clearest form a disclosure can take will depend on the nature of the information and might include tables,\ngraphs or diagrams in addition to narrative text. If graphs or diagrams are used, additional text or tables might\nbe necessary to avoid obscuring material detail.\nD28 Clarity might be enhanced by distinguishing information about developments in the reporting period from\n‘standing’ information that remains unchanged, or changes little, from one period to the next—for example,\nby separately describing features of an entity’s climate-related governance and risk management processes\nthat have changed since the previous reporting period.\nD29 Disclosures are concise if they include only material information. Any immaterial information included shall\nbe provided in a way that avoids obscuring material information.\nD30 Some climate-related risks and opportunities are inherently complex and might be difficult to present in a\nmanner that is easy to understand. An entity shall present such information as clearly as possible. However,\ncomplex information about these risks and opportunities shall not be excluded from general purpose financial\nreports to make those reports easier to understand. Excluding such information would render those reports\nincomplete and, therefore, possibly misleading.\nD31 The completeness, clarity and comparability of climate-related financial information all rely on information\nbeing presented as a coherent whole. For climate-related financial information to be coherent, it shall be\npresented in a way that explains the context and the connections between the related items of information.\nD32 If climate-related risks and opportunities located in one part of an entity’s general purpose financial reports\nhave implications for information disclosed in other parts, the entity shall include the information necessary\nfor users to assess those implications.\nD33 Coherence also requires an entity to provide information in a way that allows users to relate information about\nits climate-related risks and opportunities to information in the entity’s financial statements.\nAASB S2 44 APPENDIX D\n\nDeleted IFRS S2 text\nDeleted IFRS S2 text is not part of AASB S2.\n12 In identifying the climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity’s\nprospects, the entity shall refer to and consider the applicability of the industry-based disclosure topics defined\nin the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2.\n23 In preparing disclosures to meet the requirements in paragraphs 13–22, an entity shall refer to and consider\nthe applicability of cross-industry metric categories, as described in paragraph 29, and industry-based metrics\nassociated with disclosure topics defined in the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 as\ndescribed in paragraph 32.\n28 To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose:\n…\n(b) industry-based metrics that are associated with particular business models, activities or other\ncommon features that characterise participation in an industry (see paragraph 32);\n32 An entity shall disclose industry-based metrics that are associated with one or more particular business models,\nactivities or other common features that characterise participation in an industry. In determining the industry-\nbased metrics that the entity discloses, the entity shall refer to and consider the applicability of the industry-\nbased metrics associated with disclosure topics described in the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing\nIFRS S2.\n37 In identifying and disclosing the metrics used to set and monitor progress towards reaching a target described\nin paragraphs 33–34, an entity shall refer to and consider the applicability of cross-industry metrics (see\nparagraph 29) and industry-based metrics (see paragraph 32), including those described in an applicable IFRS\nSustainability Disclosure Standard, or metrics that otherwise satisfy the requirements in IFRS S1.\nAppendix A – the definition of ‘disclosure topic’\nA specific sustainability-related risk or opportunity based on the activities conducted by entities within a\nparticular industry as set out in an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard or a SASB Standard.\nB65 In preparing disclosures to fulfil the requirements in paragraph 29(b)–(g), an entity shall:\n…\n(d) consider whether industry-based metrics, as described in paragraph 32—including those defined in\nan applicable IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard or those that otherwise satisfy the\nrequirements in IFRS S1—could be used to satisfy the requirements in whole or in part.\nB67 In identifying and disclosing the metric used to set a climate-related target and measure progress, an entity\nshall consider the cross-industry metrics and industry-based metrics. If the metric has been developed by the\nentity to measure progress towards a target, the entity shall disclose information about that metric in\naccordance with paragraph 50 of IFRS S1.\nC1 An entity shall apply this Standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Earlier\napplication is permitted. If an entity applies this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply IFRS S1\nGeneral Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information at the same time.\nAASB S2 45 DELETED IFRS S2 TEXT\n\nBasis for Conclusions and dissenting view\nThis Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB S2.\nIntroduction\nBC1 This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s (AASB’s)\nconsiderations in developing AASB S2. In making decisions, individual Board members gave greater weight\nto some factors than to others.\nReasons for issuing this Standard\nBC2 The AASB issued AASB S2 to support the Australian Government’s decision to require large businesses and\nfinancial institutions to prepare climate-related financial disclosures.\nBC3 Following multiple consultations and responding to calls from investors for more consistent, complete,\ncomparable and verifiable information about an entity’s climate-related risks and opportunities, in 2023 the\nAustralian Government confirmed its intention to make climate-related financial disclosures mandatory for\nlarge businesses and financial institutions. In June 2023, the Commonwealth Treasury released the proposed\ndesign for a mandatory reporting framework, with an approach for Australia to be aligned as far as practicable\nwith the standards developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (the ISSB) to the extent\nrelevant to climate-related financial disclosure. The Australian Government’s policy intention is to improve\nthe quality and comparability of climate-related financial disclosures across different companies and sectors,\nwhich, in turn, should help investors make more informed decisions.\nBC4 In September 2024, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures)\nAct 2024 was passed, introducing mandatory climate-related financial disclosures for certain corporations and\nother entities through amendments to the Corporations Act 2001.\nApproach to developing AASB S2\nBC5 In March 2022, the ISSB published an Exposure Draft on [Draft] IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and an Exposure Draft on [Draft] IFRS S2 Climate-\nrelated Disclosures, which integrated and built on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD), created by the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\nBC6 In April 2022, the AASB published Exposure Draft ED 321 Request for Comment on ISSB [Draft] IFRS S1\nGeneral Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and [Draft] IFRS S2\nClimate-related Disclosures. Comments received on ED 321 indicated that the proposals in IFRS S1 and\nIFRS S2 would be an appropriate baseline on which to develop climate-related financial disclosure\nrequirements for Australian entities.\nBC7 Considering the commitment from the Australian Government to introduce internationally aligned mandatory\nclimate-related financial reporting for large businesses and financial institutions and the feedback to ED 321,\nthe AASB decided:\n(a) Australian sustainability-related reporting requirements would be in a separate suite of standards\nfrom Accounting Standards;\n(b) to use the work of the ISSB as a foundation, with modifications for Australian circumstances where\nnecessary to meet the needs of Australian stakeholders; and\n(c) to initially develop climate-related financial disclosure requirements that can be applied\nindependently of any broader sustainability reporting framework.\nBC8 The AASB noted that it may develop reporting requirements for other sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities in Australia over time.\nBC9 In June 2023, the ISSB finalised IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. In October 2023, the AASB published Exposure Draft\nED SR1 Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards – Disclosure of Climate-related Financial\nInformation. ED SR1 proposed three draft Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards, as described below.\nAASB S2 46 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\n(a) [Draft] ASRS 1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Climate-related Financial Information,\ndeveloped using the requirements of IFRS S1 as the baseline but with a scope limitation to climate-\nrelated disclosure.\n(b) [Draft] ASRS 2 Climate-related Financial Disclosures, developed using the requirements of\nIFRS S2 as the baseline. The main proposed modifications to the baseline requirements related to:\n(i) consideration and disclosure of industry-based information;\n(ii) measurement of greenhouse gas emissions; and\n(iii) temperature outcomes for scenario analysis.\n(c) [Draft] ASRS 101 References in Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards, developed as a\nservice Standard that would be updated when required to list the relevant versions of any non-\nlegislative documents published in Australia and foreign documents that are referenced in\nAustralian Sustainability Reporting Standards. Under section 14 of the Legislation Act 2003,\nAustralian legislative instruments (such as mandatory Standards) cannot make provisions in relation\nto a non-legislative document as existing from time to time. Therefore, the proposed Standards\nidentify the relevant version of all non-legislative Australian documents and foreign documents\nreferenced in the Standards to be clear as to the versions referred to. A service Standard is one\npossible approach to identifying those documents.\nBC10 When the AASB was developing ED SR1, Treasury’s Exposure Draft Treasury Laws Amendment Bill 2024:\nClimate-related financial disclosure (January 2024) had not yet been published. The AASB proposed\nmodifications to the requirements in IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 after considering Treasury’s second Consultation\nPaper, Climate-related financial disclosure (June 2023), and informal feedback from stakeholders, including\nthe Treasury, the Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water\n(DCCEEW) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). At the time,\nthe AASB discussed whether to defer the publication of ED SR1 until it had considered the Treasury’s\nexposure draft legislation and undertaken targeted outreach to gauge stakeholders’ preliminary views on some\nof its proposals. However, the AASB decided it was important to publish ED SR1 in October 2023 to enable\nthe issuance of the final Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards in time for implementation in annual\nperiods beginning on or after 1 July 2024, which was then the anticipated first application date for mandatory\nclimate-related financial disclosures by the first group of entities.\nBC11 When deciding to publish ED SR1 ahead of the Treasury’s exposure draft legislation and targeted stakeholder\noutreach, the AASB acknowledged that it might need to reconsider some of its proposals in light of the\nTreasury Exposure Draft (and the ultimate legislation) and stakeholder feedback on ED SR1. In particular, the\nAASB noted that its proposed modifications to the requirements set out in IFRS S2 for measuring greenhouse\ngas emissions and temperature outcomes for scenario analysis would likely require further consideration.\nBC12 ED SR1 was exposed for 130 days, with a comment period to 31 March 2024. Extensive outreach was\nconducted on the proposals in ED SR1, with a total of 500 attendees at the in-person roundtables in Adelaide,\nBrisbane, Canberra, Geelong, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth and Sydney, as well as virtual roundtables.\nBC13 Much of the feedback on ED SR1 favoured the requirements in IFRS S2 being incorporated in Australian\nSustainability Reporting Standards with minimal or no modifications. Many stakeholders were of the view\nthat there are few, if any, Australian-specific circumstances that would warrant departure from the baseline of\nIFRS S2 in accordance with the AASB Sustainability Reporting Standard-Setting Framework (September\n2023). The AASB also noted that a closer alignment to the IFRS S2 requirements would be consistent with\nthe Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Act 2024 (the Act).\nBC14 In May–September 2024, the AASB discussed stakeholder feedback and reconsidered its proposed\nmodifications to the baseline requirements. The AASB decided to issue two Australian Sustainability\nReporting Standards, as described below:\n(a) the voluntary Standard AASB S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related\nFinancial Information, to incorporate all IFRS S1 requirements without modification. Consistent\nwith the Australian Government’s decision to address climate-related financial disclosures first and\nto consider the development of reporting requirements for other sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities in Australia over time, the AASB decided to issue AASB S1 as a voluntary Standard\nso that an entity applying AASB S2 is not required to apply AASB S1 to disclose information on\nother sustainability-related risks and opportunities; and\n(b) the mandatory Standard AASB S2 Climate-related Disclosures, to incorporate all IFRS S2\nrequirements, with modifications only in respect to the following matters:\n(i) general requirements for disclosure of climate-related financial information;\n(ii) options under the legislative amendments regarding consolidated reporting;\nAASB S2 47 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\n(iii) consideration and disclosure of industry-based information; and\n(iv) users of a not-for-profit entity’s general purpose financial report (GPFR).\nBC15 The AASB considered whether further consultation or formal re-exposure of the proposed Standard should be\ncarried out before issuing AASB S2. The AASB noted that extensive stakeholder engagement and consultation\nhad been undertaken in developing AASB S2. The AASB received 117 comment letters and 289 survey\nresponses on ED SR1 across various stakeholder groups, including financial report preparers and auditors,\nuser groups, professional bodies, industry bodies and academics, covering both the private sector and the\npublic sector. Considering the extensive feedback received and the AASB’s decision to adopt all IFRS S2\nrequirements (except for industry-based disclosures), which is consistent with views supported by most\nstakeholders, as well as the future projects to address scalability and cost-benefit concerns and public sector\napplication matters that the AASB added to its workplan (see paragraphs BC79–BC84), the AASB decided\nthat further consultation or re-exposure was not required.\nBC16 Since the AASB decided to issue only one mandatory Standard (i.e. to make only AASB S2 as an Australian\nlegislative instrument), the AASB decided not to issue the service Standard [draft] ASRS 101 proposed in\nED SR1. Instead, AASB S2 directly identifies the relevant versions of non-legislative Australian documents\nand foreign documents referenced in the Standard (for example, see paragraphs AusB22.1 and AusB63.1).\nThe AASB will amend AASB S2 as soon as practicable when required to refer to later versions of referenced\ndocuments.\nBC17 The following paragraphs summarise the key matters considered by the AASB in developing AASB S2,\nincluding the Board’s decisions on how to address stakeholders’ feedback.\nGeneral requirements for disclosure of climate-related financial\ninformation\nBC18 IFRS S1 sets out the general requirements for a complete set of sustainability-related financial disclosures.\nIFRS S1 is designed to be applied in conjunction with IFRS S2, which is a topic-based Standard that specifies\ndisclosures relating to climate. As noted in paragraph BC14(a), consistent with the Australian Government’s\ndecision to address climate-related financial disclosures first and to consider the development of reporting\nrequirements for other sustainability-related risks and opportunities in Australia over time, the AASB decided\nto issue AASB S1 as a voluntary Standard so that an entity applying AASB S2 is not required to apply\nAASB S1 to disclose information on other sustainability-related risks and opportunities.\nBC19 Consequently, the AASB added paragraphs Aus7.1 and Aus26.1 to clarify that the requirements set out in\nIFRS S2 paragraphs 7 and 26 apply particularly if an entity elects to also apply AASB S1 to disclose\ninformation about other sustainability-related risks and opportunities in addition to climate-related risks and\nopportunities in GPFR. The paragraphs require an entity to avoid unnecessary duplication of disclosures by\nproviding integrated disclosures instead of separate disclosures for each sustainability-related risk and\nopportunity, if oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities is managed on an integrated basis.\nBC20 Since AASB S1 is a voluntary Standard, the AASB included Appendix D General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Climate-related Financial Information in AASB S2 to incorporate the content of IFRS S1\nnecessary to enable AASB S2 to function as the standalone mandatory Standard containing all of the\nrequirements regarding climate-related disclosures. Consequently, where IFRS S2 cross-references to\nIFRS S1 paragraphs, AASB S2 cross-references to Appendix D paragraphs.1 Accordingly, AASB S2 contains\nall the requirements an entity would need to apply in reporting climate-related financial disclosures in\naccordance with AASB S2.\nBC21 In assessing the contents of IFRS S1 needed to make AASB S2 function as intended, the AASB considered\nwhether:\n(a) an IFRS S1 principle, disclosure or guidance is already incorporated in AASB S2;\n(b) an IFRS S1 principle reflects content already in the AASB’s Conceptual Framework for Financial\nReporting (in respect to for-profit entities) and the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation\nof Financial Statements (in respect to not-for-profit entities) that are available as support material\nfor applying AASB S2,2 including considering the extent to which that content is the same; and\n(c) the IFRS S1 content reflects corresponding content in Accounting Standards, i.e. material\nconsidered necessary to include in Accounting Standards to enable them to function.\n1 Except for cross-references in IFRS S2 paragraphs B34–B36 to IFRS S1 paragraphs B6(b) and B11. The requirements set out in IFRS S1\nparagraphs B6(b) and B11 are consistent with IFRS S2 paragraphs B34 and B36; consequently, cross-references to IFRS S1 paragraphs\nB6(b) and B11 are omitted in AASB S2 paragraphs B34–B36.\n2 As noted in AASB S1 paragraphs D1 and D2.\nAASB S2 48 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nBC22 The AASB’s Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and the Framework for the Preparation and\nPresentation of Financial Statements are not legislative instruments and do not form part of the authoritative\nAustralian Accounting Standards. While some Australian Accounting Standards refer to aspects of those\nFrameworks, the Frameworks themselves are not enforceable. Accordingly, ED SR1 proposed that the\nconceptual content set out in IFRS S1 should not be made enforceable.\nBC23 Some stakeholders commented that the context for sustainability reporting is different from the context for\nfinancial statements, for which there is a comprehensive set of Accountings Standards prescribing reporting\nrequirements for a set of general purpose financial statements. They consider that conceptual content would\nbe needed to help preparers ensure reported climate-related financial information is relevant to users and\nfaithfully represents the substance of the effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on an entity’s cash\nflows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. The AASB also re-evaluated\nthe context in which the conceptual content set out in IFRS S1 is provided, and its nature, and observed that\nthe content:\n(a) does not seek to be a framework for evaluating proposed standards, as the role of a Conceptual\nFramework not having the force of an accounting standard is described in the AASB’s enabling\nlegislation;3 and\n(b) is largely similar in nature to counterpart principles incorporated in some Australian Accounting\nStandards.\nBC24 Accordingly, the AASB concluded it would include the conceptual content in IFRS S1 in Appendix D in\nAASB S2, together with the other general principles in IFRS S1 that are considered necessary to enable\nAASB S2 to function as intended.\nBC25 In concluding that the general disclosure requirements needed to make AASB S2 function as intended should\nbe located in Appendix D, the AASB noted its convention of including mandatory content supporting the body\nof a Standard in an Appendix, which is consistent with international conventions.4\nOptions for consolidated reporting\nBC26 In accordance with IFRS S1 paragraphs 20 and B38, an entity’s climate-related financial disclosures are\nrequired to be prepared for the same reporting entity as the related financial statements. That is, to comply\nwith IFRS S2, an entity would prepare climate-related financial disclosures for its consolidated group if the\nrelated financial statements are prepared for that consolidated group.\nBC27 However, the AASB observed that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other\nMeasures) Act 2024 does not require the parent entity of a consolidated group to prepare climate-related\nfinancial disclosures for its consolidated group. Under section 292A(2) of the Corporations Act, as inserted\nby the legislative amendments, a parent entity has the choice of preparing a sustainability report for either the\nconsolidated entity or the parent entity. Accordingly, the AASB added paragraphs Aus20.1 and AusB38.1 to\nAppendix D of AASB S2 to specify that an entity’s climate-related financial disclosures shall be for the same\nreporting entity as the related financial statements unless otherwise permitted by law.\nConsideration and disclosure of industry-based information\nBC28 The AASB decided, as an interim measure, not to require industry-based disclosures to be provided and\ntherefore also not to require entities to consider the applicability of disclosure topics (and the industry-based\nmetrics associated with those disclosure topics) defined in the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n(SASB) Standards and Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 issued by the ISSB. Consequently,\nthe AASB:\n(a) modified or omitted the requirements set out in IFRS S2 paragraphs 12, 23, 28(b), 32, 37, B65(d)\nand B67; and\n(b) omitted the definition of “disclosure topic” set out in IFRS S2 Appendix A Defined terms.\nBC29 Feedback on ED 321 indicated strong support among respondents for developing mandatory requirements for\nindustry-based disclosures as part of the ISSB’s approach to standard-setting for sustainability-related\nfinancial information. However, many of those respondents did not support the ISSB's proposed industry-\nbased disclosure requirements, which became the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2. The\n3 Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, section 227(1).\n4 This is the convention adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and the International Sustainability Standards Board.\nAASB S2 49 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nmajority of respondents to ED SR1 supported the AASB’s proposal to omit these requirements, but requested\nthe AASB undertake further work to develop industry-based disclosure requirements for Australian entities.\nBC30 Acknowledging this feedback, the AASB made decisions regarding the consideration and disclosure of\nindustry-based information as an interim measure, signalling its intention to redeliberate this matter in the near\nfuture. The AASB added a project to its workplan with respect to industry-based disclosure requirements. This\nproject will focus on determining the appropriate basis and content of the industry-based disclosures, including\nassessing the industry-based classification system, the applicability of the industry-based disclosure topics and\nthe industry-based metrics defined in the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2. The Treasury\nPolicy Position Statement Mandatory climate-related financial disclosures (January 2024) states that “Entities\nshould only be required to disclose against well-established and understood industry-based metrics from 1 July\n2030 onwards.” Accordingly, the AASB intends to finalise mandatory requirements for industry-based\ndisclosures by 2030.\nUsers of a not-for-profit entity’s GPFR\nBC31 Under the Corporations Act amendments, some not-for-profit entities will be required to disclose climate-\nrelated financial information. To support those requirements, as noted in the AASB Sustainability Reporting\nStandard-Setting Framework, the AASB has determined that it will, as far as is practicable, focus on\ndeveloping sector-neutral Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards. That is, it is the AASB’s intention to\ndevelop transaction-neutral sustainability reporting Standards where possible. A transaction (or sector)\nneutrality approach to sustainability reporting Standards means that like transactions, other events and\nconditions are considered in a like manner for all types of entities, whatever their sector of activity, unless\nthere is a justifiable reason not to do so. Accordingly, the AASB considered whether any modifications to the\nIFRS S2 baseline requirements might be needed for not-for-profit entities.\nBC32 The AASB decided to add paragraph AusA1 in Appendix A Defined terms to require a not-for-profit entity to\nrefer to the meaning of “general purpose financial reports” and “primary users of general purpose financial\nreports” specified in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements when\napplying AASB S2. The AASB also added guidance in paragraphs AusB14.1 and AusB15.1 in Appendix D\nGeneral Requirements for Disclosure of Climate-related Financial Information to AASB S2.\nBC33 The AASB added those paragraphs because:\n(a) IFRS S2 defines “primary users of general purpose financial reports” as existing and potential\ninvestors, lenders and other creditors, whereas users of a not-for-profit entity’s GPFR described in\nthe Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements also include\nparliaments, taxpayers, donors and recipients of goods and services; and\n(b) the definition of “general purpose financial reports” in IFRS S2 states that users’ decision-making\ninvolves decisions about (1) buying, selling or holding equity and debt instruments; (2)\nproviding or selling loans and other forms of credit; or (3) exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise\ninfluence, the entity’s management’s actions that affect the use of the entity’s economic resources.\nIn respect to not-for-profit entities, paragraph AusOB3.1 of the Framework for the Preparation and\nPresentation of Financial Statements states that “users (such as certain existing and potential\nresource providers) are generally not concerned with obtaining a financial return on an investment\nin the entity. Rather, they are concerned with the ability of the entity to achieve its objectives\n(whether financial or nonfinancial), which in turn may depend, at least in part, on the entity’s\nprospects for future net cash inflows. Users will, for example, be interested in the capability of the\nentity’s resources to provide goods and services in the future.”\nBC34 Additionally, paragraph AusOB2.1 of the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial\nStatements provides examples of the resource allocation decisions of users of a not-for-profit entity’s GPFR.\nThe examples include:\n(a) parliaments decide, on behalf of constituents, whether to fund particular programmes for delivery\nby an entity;\n(b) taxpayers decide who should represent them in government;\n(c) donors decide whether to donate resources to an entity, and\n(d) recipients of goods and services decide whether they can continue to rely on the provision of goods\nand services from the entity or whether to seek alternative suppliers.\nBC35 ED SR1 proposed to modify the objective of the Standard so that a not-for-profit entity would be required to\nconsider the effect of climate-related risks and opportunities on “the entity’s ability to further its objectives”\nin addition to considering the effect on the entity’s cash flows and its access to finance or cost of capital over\nAASB S2 50 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nthe short, medium and long term. Some stakeholders expressed concerns that the proposed modifications\nwould imply a different basis of reporting for not-for-profit entities, compared to for-profit entities, either\nnarrowing or widening the scope of climate-related risks and opportunities to be considered, which was not\nthe AASB’s intention. The AASB decided not to introduce the phrase “the entity’s ability to further its\nobjectives” in describing the objective of the Standard for not-for-profit entities, but to require a not-for-profit\nentity to refer to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements when applying\nAASB S2, as noted above.\nMeasurement of greenhouse gas emissions\nBC36 For the measurement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the AASB decided to align with the measurement\nhierarchy in IFRS S2 without modification. That hierarchy requires an entity to apply a method in the\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) to measure GHG\nemissions, but permits an entity to apply a different method when required to do so by a jurisdictional authority\nor an exchange on which the entity is listed.5 Accordingly, if an entity is required by an Australian authority\n(e.g. Australian legislation) to use a specific method for measuring its GHG emissions (e.g. methodologies in\nNGER Scheme legislation6), doing so would mean that such an entity would not have departed from IFRS S2.\nBC37 ED SR1 proposed requiring an entity to prioritise relevant methodologies in NGER Scheme legislation. This\nwas consistent with Treasury’s second consultation paper in June 2023, which indicated that the Australian\nGovernment would require an entity to apply methodologies set out in NGER Scheme legislation as the default\nmethodologies in measuring its GHG emissions. Considering stakeholders’ interest in closer alignment with\nIFRS S2, the AASB decided to align with the GHG emission measurement requirements set out in IFRS S2\nparagraph 29(a), and therefore prioritise the GHG Protocol, and not NGER Scheme legislation, as the default\nframework for measuring GHG emissions.\nBC38 The AASB considered that aligning with IFRS S2 would:\n(a) support interoperability with other GHG reporting frameworks, such as European Sustainability\nReporting Standards (ESRS), that also refer to the GHG Protocol;\n(b) allow flexibility for both NGER and non-NGER reporters to determine the most appropriate and\ncost-effective methods to report their GHG emissions, including determining appropriate reporting\nboundaries for GHG emissions; and\n(c) facilitate implementation by avoiding the need for an entity to determine whether applying a method\nin NGER Scheme legislation is practicable.\nBC39 AASB S2 paragraphs B22 and B29 require an entity to use emission factors that best represent the activity\nthat is generating the GHG emissions. This requirement would apply irrespective of whether an entity\nmeasures GHG emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and\nReporting Standard (2004) or in accordance with the methods required by a jurisdictional authority or an\nexchange on which the entity is listed.\nDefinition of greenhouse gases\nBC40 The AASB decided to retain the IFRS S2 definition of greenhouse gases as the seven greenhouse gases listed\nin the Kyoto Protocol, as proposed in ED SR1.\nBC41 The AASB observed that nitrogen trifluoride (NF ) is not listed in NGER Scheme legislation as a class of\ngreenhouse gas. Upon considering feedback received on ED SR1, the AASB decided to retain NF in the\ndefinition of greenhouse gases. This is because it would:\n(a) not conflict with the NGER Scheme legislation—it would be an addition to the requirements in\nNGER Scheme legislation;\n(b) be unlikely to have a significant effect on Australian entities reporting under NGER Scheme\nlegislation. The CSIRO informed the AASB that NF emissions are currently immaterial in\nAustralia because NF is primarily produced in the manufacture of semiconductors, liquid crystal\n5 For brevity, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\nCorporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011) are referred to in this Basis for Conclusions as “GHG\nProtocol”.\n6 For the purposes of this Basis for Conclusions, NGER Scheme legislation means:\n(a) the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007;\n(b) the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Regulation 2008; and\n(c) the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008.\nAASB S2 51 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\ndisplay (LCD) panels, certain types of solar panels and chemical lasers and Australia does not have\na significant presence in the manufacturing of these items; and\n(c) accommodate the potential increase of NF in Australia, in particular, considering Australia’s policy\nambition to be a renewable energy superpower with allied downstream manufacturing industries\nwhich may lead to more NF emissions given it is used in the manufacture of renewable technologies\n(e.g. solar panels).7 Should NF emissions become material in Australia in the future, the Clean\nEnergy Regulator and DCCEEW may consider requiring NGER reporters to also report on NF to\nalign with the reporting needed under the Paris Agreement.\nConverting greenhouse gases into a CO equivalent value\nBC42 The AASB decided to incorporate in AASB S2 without modification the requirements set out in IFRS S2\nparagraphs B21 and B22 with respect to the requirement to convert greenhouse gases into a CO equivalent\nvalue.\nBC43 To align with the reporting requirements related to the Paris Agreement and NGER Scheme legislation,\nED SR1 proposed to require an entity to convert greenhouse gases into a CO equivalent value using the global\nwarming potential (GWP) values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5), instead of the GWP values from the latest IPCC assessment available at the\nreporting date (the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), which is the latest report available at the time of issuing\nthis Standard).\nBC44 Considering stakeholders’ significant support for closer alignment with IFRS S2, the AASB decided not to\nmodify the requirements set out in paragraphs B21 and B22 of IFRS S2. In making this decision, the AASB\nnoted that in accordance with paragraph B22 of this Standard, if an entity uses appropriate emission factors\nthat have already converted the constituent gases into CO equivalent values, the entity would not be required\nto recalculate the emission factors using GWP values from the latest IPCC assessment available at the\nreporting date. The Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors have already converted greenhouse\ngases into CO equivalent values using the GWP values from IPCC AR5, which is consistent with the Paris\nAgreement.\nMarket-based Scope 2 GHG emissions\nBC45 The AASB considered but decided not to mandate disclosure of market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions.\nBC46 Consistent with the Treasury’s second consultation paper, ED SR1 proposed to require an entity to disclose\nits market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions from the fourth year of applying Australian Sustainability Reporting\nStandards. Upon considering stakeholder feedback, the AASB decided that such a mandate is unnecessary.\nThis is because:\n(a) under IFRS S2 (and AASB S2), entities might provide information about their market-based\nScope 2 GHG emissions if they consider it would be useful to the users of their climate-related\nfinancial disclosures; and\n(b) if NGER Scheme legislation is updated in the future to require the reporting of market-based\nScope 2 GHG emissions, NGER reporters may elect to disclose that information when preparing\nclimate-related financial disclosures under AASB S2.\nScope 3 GHG emission categories\nBC47 Consistent with IFRS S2, the AASB decided to require an entity to disclose the sources of its Scope 3 GHG\nemissions using the 15 categories in the GHG Protocol.\nBC48 ED SR1 proposed not to prescribe specific categories an entity must use to categorise its sources of Scope 3\nGHG emissions. Instead, ED SR1 included the 15 categories in the GHG Protocol as examples of categories\nthat an entity could consider when categorising the sources of its emissions.\nBC49 The AASB observed that there was a consensus among stakeholders that the 15 categories in the GHG Protocol\nare well understood, sufficiently broad, and widely applied by entities in Australia and internationally.\nAccordingly, the AASB decided to incorporate in AASB S2 the requirements set out in IFRS S2 paragraphs\nB32–B33 without modification.\n7 Parliament of Australia, Australia’s trade and investment opportunities in a global green economy, October 2023, available via\nhttps://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/committees/reportjnt/RB000034/toc_pdf/Australia'stradeandinvestmentopportunitiesinagl\nobalgreeneconomy.pdf.\nAASB S2 52 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nBC50 The ISSB noted in paragraph BC110 of the Basis for Conclusions to IFRS S2 that the categories included in\nan entity’s Scope 3 measurement will depend on the entity’s facts and circumstances. An entity is required to\nconsider the relevance of all 15 categories, but might determine that not all categories are applicable to the\nentity and therefore do not need to be included in the disclosure of its Scope 3 GHG emissions.\nBC51 Chapter 5 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting\nStandard (2011) states that any Scope 3 activities not captured by the 15 categories may be reported separately.\nConsistent with IFRS S1 paragraphs 15(b) and B26 (incorporated in Appendix D of AASB S2) regarding\nproviding additional information to ensure a fair presentation in the GPFR, an entity separately reports material\nScope 3 GHG emissions that are not captured by the activities under the 15 categories in the GHG Protocol.\nReporting Scope 3 GHG emissions using information for a period\ndifferent from the entity’s reporting period\nBC52 The AASB observed that paragraph B19 of the Standard (and IFRS S2) allows an entity to measure its GHG\nemissions using information for reporting periods that are different from its own reporting period, if certain\nconditions are met. Therefore, the AASB decided to omit from AASB S2 paragraph AusB39.1 in [draft]\nASRS 2 as proposed in ED SR1, which proposed to permit an entity to measure and disclose its Scope 3 GHG\nemissions using data for the immediately preceding reporting period if reasonable and supportable data related\nto the current reporting period is unavailable. That proposal was consistent with the Treasury’s second\nconsultation paper that Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards were expected to provide additional\nrelief to allow entities to disclose estimates of their Scope 3 GHG emissions relating to any one-year period,\nup to 12 months prior to the relevant reporting period.\nBC53 There was general support from stakeholders for the flexibility to allow entities to use Scope 3 GHG emission\ninformation obtained from its value chain partners for a period that differs from its reporting period in certain\ncircumstances, which is consistent with the provision in paragraph B19 of the Standard (and IFRS S2).\nFinanced emissions\nBC54 Consistent with IFRS S2, the AASB decided to require entities participating in financial activities of asset\nmanagement, commercial banking or insurance to provide the additional and specific financed-emission\ndisclosures set out in IFRS S2 paragraphs B61–B63.\nBC55 ED SR1 proposed to require such an entity to consider the applicability of those additional disclosures, rather\nthan requiring disclosure of the financed emission information, to solicit feedback from stakeholders on\nwhether all such financed emission information would be relevant and useful to Australian entities that\nparticipate in asset management, commercial banking or insurance activities.\nBC56 Some stakeholders expressed concerns that:\n(a) the requirement in IFRS S2 paragraphs B62 and B63 for an entity to disclose disaggregation of an\nentity’s absolute gross financed emission by Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for each industry by asset\nclass could be challenging due to potentially limited availability of value chain data and would\ncreate an unnecessary administrative burden for reporting entities; and\n(b) there is currently no industry standard for calculating financed emissions for undrawn commitments.\nBC57 The AASB acknowledged the stakeholders’ concerns described in paragraph BC56 and that more time may\nbe needed for entities to prepare the additional financed emission information. However, the AASB observed\nthat the transition relief provided by paragraph C4(b) for an entity to not disclose its Scope 3 GHG emissions\nin the first year of applying the Standard means that an entity that participates in financial activities of asset\nmanagement, commercial banking or insurance is required to prepare the additional financed emission\ninformation set out in paragraphs B61–B63 only from the second year of applying AASB S2. Accordingly,\nthe AASB decided that no modification is needed relating to the requirements set out in those IFRS S2\nparagraphs.\nBC58 The AASB noted the ISSB confirmed that IFRS S2 requires financed emission disclosure only for insurance-\nrelated financial activities associated with an insurer’s assets. In other words, IFRS S2 does not require\ndisclosure of the ‘associated emissions’ of underwriting portfolios in the insurance and reinsurance industries.\nThe AASB also noted that, for all financial activities, the ISSB decided to remove the proposal for an entity\nto include derivatives when calculating its financed emissions. The AASB adopted the same position as the\nISSB for insurance-related financial activities and derivatives.\nAASB S2 53 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nOther key matters considered by the AASB in developing AASB S2\nBC59 Other key matters considered in developing AASB S2 but for which the AASB decided that no modification\nor addition to the baseline of IFRS S2 is warranted included:\n(a) whether to specify temperature outcomes for scenario analysis;\n(b) cross-industry remuneration disclosure;\n(c) internal carbon prices;\n(d) definition of carbon credits;\n(e) carbon offsets and greenhouse gas removals; and\n(f) superannuation entity application issues.\nWhether to specify temperature outcomes for scenario analysis\nBC60 The AASB decided to align with the requirements in IFRS S2 and not prescribe specific temperature outcomes\nfor scenario analysis.\nBC61 Consistent with the Treasury’s second consultation paper, ED SR1 proposed to require assessment against at\nleast two relevant possible future states, one of which must be consistent with the most ambitious global\ntemperature goal set out in the Climate Change Act 2022 (i.e. 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels). Most\nstakeholders who responded to ED SR1 on this topic supported additional requirements to the baseline of\nIFRS S2 with respect to scenario analysis, on the basis that any additional requirements would not be a\ndeparture from IFRS S2. Specifically:\n(a) most stakeholders supported the proposals in ED SR1;\n(b) many stakeholders preferred the Standard to also specify a requirement to assess a high-warming\nscenario to ensure that a high-warming world is considered. Some of those stakeholders preferred\nthe Standard to specify the temperature outcome to assess, but there was no consensus among\nstakeholders on which high-warming outcome to specify; and\n(c) some of those stakeholders described in (a) and (b) who preferred the Standard to prescribe\ntemperature outcome(s) also preferred specifying the scenario pathway, or the time horizon,\nrequired for each prescribed temperature outcome.\nBC62 The AASB observed that those stakeholder preferences have been addressed by the Treasury Laws\nAmendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Act 2024. That Act specifies the minimum\nrequirements relating to climate scenario analysis, which includes assessing both a high-warming scenario and\na low-warming scenario. Subsection 296D(2B) of the Corporations Act (as amended) states that:\n“… disclosure of a scenario analysis, information derived from a scenario analysis or information\nabout a scenario analysis is taken not to satisfy that requirement unless the scenario analysis is\ncarried out using at least both of the following scenarios:\n(a) the increase in the global average temperature well exceeds the increase mentioned in\nsubparagraph 3(a)(i) of the Climate Change Act 2022;\n(b) the increase in the global average temperature is limited to the increase mentioned in\nsubparagraph 3(a)(ii) of that Act.”\nBC63 Subparagraph 3(a)(i) of the Climate Change Act states “… holding the increase in the global average\ntemperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels”, and subparagraph 3(a)(ii) states “… pursuing\nefforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” Paragraph 2.17 of the\nsupplementary Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market\nInfrastructure and Other Measures) Act 2024 states that an increase of 2.5°C or higher would be considered\nto well exceed the increase mentioned in subparagraph 3(a)(i) of the Climate Change Act.\nBC64 The AASB considered whether to specify in AASB S2 the minimum requirements relating to scenario analysis\nas set out in the legislation. The AASB decided not to do so because:\n(a) AASB S2 sets out the principles for assessing an entity’s climate resilience using scenario analysis.\nThe number of relevant scenarios to assess would depend on the entity’s facts and circumstances,\nincluding the nature and location of its operations and the physical and transition risks to which it\nis exposed (see paragraphs BC66–BC69 of the Basis for Conclusions to IFRS S2). It is not the role\nof the Standard to prescribe specific temperature outcomes for scenario analysis; and\n(b) prescribing specific temperature outcomes in AASB S2 would require future amendments to ensure\nthe prescribed temperature outcomes remained consistent with Australian legislation.\nAASB S2 54 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nCross-industry remuneration disclosure\nBC65 The AASB decided to align with the requirements in IFRS S2 with respect to cross-industry remuneration\ndisclosure.\nBC66 Some stakeholders commented that:\n(a) the degree of interpretative uncertainty relating to the terms ‘executive’, ‘executive management’\nand ‘remuneration’ is unlikely to be sufficiently significant to warrant modification from the\nbaseline of IFRS S2. Consequently, the AASB decided to omit paragraph Aus29.1 proposed in\n[draft] ASRS 2 that referred to the ‘key management personnel’ and ‘compensation’ definitions in\nAASB 124 Related Party Disclosures; and\n(b) there may be challenges in calculating the percentage of remuneration linked to climate-related\nconsiderations based on remuneration recognised under Accounting Standards. The AASB\ndetermined that any challenges identified by stakeholders in applying the requirements set out in\nparagraph 29(g) of IFRS S2 do not represent matters specific to the Australian environment that\nwould warrant departure from the baseline of IFRS S2 in accordance with the AASB Sustainability\nReporting Standard-Setting Framework (September 2023).\nBC67 Additionally, some stakeholders commented that information prepared under the requirements set out in\nparagraph 29(g) of IFRS S2, on a standalone basis, might appear out of context relative to the existing\nremuneration disclosure requirements set out in Australian legislation for ASX-listed and APRA-regulated\nentities. The AASB observed that under paragraph 63 of IFRS S1, entities (including ASX-listed entities and\nAPRA-regulated entities) are permitted to disclose information required under paragraph 29(g) of AASB S2\nby cross-referencing to their remuneration reports, if the conditions in paragraphs B45–B47 of IFRS S1 are\nmet. The AASB decided to incorporate those IFRS S1 paragraphs in Appendix D of AASB S2.\nInternal carbon prices\nBC68 Paragraph 29(f) requires an entity to disclose the following information:\n(a) an explanation of whether and how the entity is applying a carbon price in decision-making (for\nexample, investment decisions, transfer pricing and scenario analysis); and\n(b) the price for each metric tonne of greenhouse gas emissions the entity uses to assess the costs of its\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nBC69 Some stakeholders commented that the internal carbon price adopted by an entity is commercially sensitive.\nThey commented that, in the energy sector, mandatory disclosure of this information could give competitors\nvaluable insight into the cost structures, operational efficiencies and strategic decision making (including risk\nmanagement) of the entity.\nBC70 The AASB noted that paragraphs 73 and B34–B37 of IFRS S1 relieve an entity from disclosing information\nabout a sustainability-related opportunity that is commercially sensitive. The AASB decided to incorporate\nthose IFRS S1 paragraphs in Appendix D.\nDefinition of carbon credits\nBC71 The AASB decided to align with the IFRS S2 definition of carbon credits with no modification.\nBC72 ED SR1 proposed to amend the definition of carbon credits to include an explicit reference to the Australian\nCarbon Credit Unit (ACCU) Scheme. The AASB considered stakeholder feedback and observed that\nmodifying the definition of carbon credits could have the unintended consequences of:\n(a) implying that all emission units recognised under the ACCU Scheme are not ‘carbon credits’ under\nIFRS S2, and that other Australian domestic emission units (e.g. Safeguard Mechanism credit units)\nshould be treated differently from ACCUs in the context of reporting net GHG emission targets;\n(b) reducing an entity’s application of judgement regarding which offsetting measures meet the carbon\ncredit definition; and\n(c) reducing the ability of the Standard to accommodate the future development of any new emission\noffset programs if the ACCU Scheme is specifically included in the definition of carbon credits.\nCarbon offsets and greenhouse gas removals\nBC73 Some stakeholders commented that IFRS S2 specifies the disclosure requirements about carbon credits (in\nparagraph 36(e)) but is unclear about the reporting requirements relating to carbon offsets and GHG removals.\nAASB S2 55 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nIFRS S2 paragraph B68 establishes the principle that net GHG emissions targets are the entity’s targeted gross\nGHG emissions minus any planned offsetting efforts. The AASB is of the view that when reporting net GHG\nemissions targets an entity could include the effects of any material carbon credits, carbon offsets and GHG\nremovals.\nBC74 In accordance with IFRS S1 paragraphs 15(b) and B26 (incorporated in Appendix D of AASB S2) regarding\nproviding additional information to ensure a fair presentation in the GPFR, to meet the disclosure objective\nrelated to metrics and targets the AASB is of the view that where information about carbon offsets or GHG\nremovals is material, an entity would be required to disclose sufficient information about these offsetting\nefforts to enable users of GPFR to understand progress towards any climate-related targets.\nSuperannuation entity application issues\nBC75 The AASB did not identify any superannuation-specific issues that would warrant modifications to the\nrequirements set out in IFRS S2.\nBC76 Some stakeholders raised concerns about the costs that might be incurred by superannuation funds to prepare\nclimate-related financial disclosures and commented that there are multiple entities associated with the\noperation of a superannuation fund. They requested the AASB to clarify which entities related to operating a\nsuperannuation fund would be within the scope of AASB S2. The AASB observed that this issue is not unique\nto the superannuation industry and is relevant also to any collective managed investment vehicle. IFRS S1\nparagraph 20 (incorporated in Appendix D as paragraph Aus20.1) states that an entity’s sustainability-related\ndisclosures shall be for the same reporting entity as the related financial statements. Accordingly, entities\nsubject to climate-related disclosure requirements should be the same as those to which AASB 1056\nSuperannuation Entities applies. The Basis for Conclusions to AASB 1056 (paragraphs BC23–BC41)\ndiscusses the reporting entity concept and superannuation entities.\nBC77 Many stakeholders who responded to this topic also commented that the users of GPFR of a superannuation\nentity, as described in paragraph BC12 of the Basis for Conclusions to AASB 1056, are broader than the users\nof GPFR defined in Appendix A of IFRS S2. Most of these stakeholders indicated that the differences could\nlead to different climate-related disclosure requirements for superannuation entities compared with other types\nof entities. Some stakeholders indicated that the reporting requirements for superannuation entities should be\ncalibrated to generate information that would be useful to the average member of a superannuation fund.\nBC78 In contrast, some other stakeholders commented that there are no superannuation entity-specific challenges\nassociated with the requirements set out in IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. They commented that superannuation\nentities are no different from other types of entities that make investments as a profit-making activity,\nincluding insurers, and the same climate-related disclosure requirements should apply to such investment\nactivities regardless of the entity type.\nPublic sector application issues\nBC79 The AASB does not have the authority to mandate which entities are required to comply with AASB S2. In\nrespect to public sector entities, the relevant authority in each jurisdiction in Australia will decide which, if\nany, of their public sector entities would need to comply with all or some of the requirements set out in\nAASB S2.\nBC80 The AASB is aware that the Treasury/Finance Departments and the Offices of Local Government in a few\njurisdictions are planning to develop climate-related financial disclosure requirements for their public sector\nentities based on AASB S2. Similar to the feedback on ED SR1, some AASB members were concerned that\nAASB S2 might not be suitable for application by not-for-profit public sector entities without further\nmodification, noting differences in the governance structure, objectives and functions of such entities\ncompared to private sector entities. For example, there are public-sector-specific implications associated with\nthe application of AASB S2, including:\n(a) the appropriate identification of the reporting entity and the subsequent level of reporting (e.g. whole\nof state, whole of government or individual agencies); and\n(b) how to determine the value chain of a government and public sector entities with multi-stakeholder\ngroups.\nBC81 The feedback received by the AASB from Australian stakeholders on the IPSASB Consultation Paper\nAdvancing Public Sector Sustainability Reporting (May 2022) indicated their preference for the Australian\nreporting requirements to align with any future global public-sector-specific sustainability reporting guidance.\nThe IPSASB is undertaking its own Climate-related Disclosures project to develop a Standard that would\nprovide not-for-profit public-sector-specific guidance on climate-related disclosures.\nAASB S2 56 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nBC82 In accordance with the AASB Sustainability Reporting Standard-Setting Framework, the AASB added a\nproject to its workplan to consider whether modifications to AASB S2 or guidance would need to be developed\nfor Australian not-for-profit public sector entities. The AASB decided that the project would begin by\nconsidering the forthcoming IPSASB Exposure Draft on climate-related disclosures, which is expected to be\npublished in October 2024.\nScalability and cost-benefit considerations for not-for-profit and smaller\nentities\nBC83 The AASB noted scalability and cost-benefit concerns raised by stakeholders representing not-for-profit\nprivate and public sector entities and smaller entities (large proprietary companies) that would be required to\ncomply with AASB S2 under the phase-in requirements of the Corporations Act amendments. Some of those\nstakeholders commented that:\n(a) the proportionality mechanisms in the baseline of IFRS S2 are insufficient to address scalability and\ncost-benefit concerns for not-for-profit entities and smaller entities in Australia; and\n(b) the level of education and upskilling required by preparers in order to implement the proposed\nStandards, including involving external consultants or specialists, would be expensive, require\nsignificant time and investment, and be potentially cost-prohibitive for not-for-profit entities and\nsmaller unlisted entities.\nBC84 The AASB observed that the areas of concern mainly related to the requirements to measure Scope 3 GHG\nemissions and to undertake climate-related scenario analysis, which are specifically mentioned in the\nCorporations Act amendments. The AASB decided to undertake a project to explore potential solutions for\naddressing scalability and cost-benefit concerns for not-for-profit entities and smaller entities.\nImpact analysis\nBC85 The AASB issued AASB S2 to support the Australian legislation (as outlined in the Corporations Act\namendments) that requires large businesses and financial institutions to prepare climate-related financial\ndisclosures. The AASB has been advised by the Office of Impact Analysis that the AASB does not need to\nundertake an Impact Analysis for the mandatory climate-related disclosure Standard on the basis that the\nregulatory impact has already been calculated by the Treasury in relation to the proposed legislative\namendments and assessed by the OIA (refer OIA, Published Impact Analysis “Climate risk disclosure”,\nJanuary 2024).\nBC86 As described in paragraphs BC79–BC84, some AASB members have concerns that some public sector\napplication issues have not yet been addressed and the benefits of applying AASB S2 may not exceed the\ncosts for some entities. However, they note that these issues will be considered in the future AASB projects\ndescribed in paragraphs BC82 and BC84, and AASB S2 will be the subject of a post-implementation review\nwhich will commence shortly after entities begin application.\nBC87 Furthermore, the AASB notes that the Australian Government will conduct a review of climate disclosure\nrequirements in 2028–29. The Treasury Policy Position Statement Mandatory climate-related financial\ndisclosures (January 2024) states that the Australian Government will conduct a review of climate disclosure\nrequirements in 2028–29. The review will be led by Treasury, working with the Council of Financial\nRegulators. At a minimum, the review will examine the effectiveness of coverage settings (particularly the\napproach to Group 3 entities), appropriateness of the liability framework and whether there are any other\nbarriers that may be affecting a company’s ability to make quality disclosures, including data availability, and\nsupporting materials.\nEffective date\nBC88 The financial period in which an entity is first required to apply AASB S2 is specified in the Corporations Act\nas amended by the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Act\n2024. It specifies three application dates (financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025, 1 July 2026\nand 1 July 2027) for the various classes of entity, based on entity size or, for NGER reporters, on level of\nemissions.\nBC89 To support the Corporations Act requirements, AASB S2 has an effective date of annual reporting periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2025. However, entities required to comply with the Standard follow their\napplication date as set out in the legislation. Earlier application is permitted.\nAASB S2 57 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\n\nDissenting view\nDissent of Caroline Spencer\nDV1 I consider the AASB did what was necessary in the circumstances to develop AASB S2 to support the\nAustralian Government’s decision to require certain large businesses and financial institutions to prepare\nclimate-related financial disclosures in annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.\nHowever, given this internationally-aligned Standard is developed based on IFRS S1 and IFRS S2, which\nhave been designed for larger for-profit entities to meet their investors’ needs, I am not confident that\napplication to smaller and not-for-profit entities in the private and public sectors meets the threshold for my\nsupport as an AASB Board member, of being in ‘the best interests of the private and public sectors in the\nAustralian economy’.\nDV2 In particular, I have concerns around the cost, the usefulness and the auditability of these reporting\nrequirements. As far as I can discern, they have never been fully implemented or audited anywhere in the\nworld, even for the largest reporting entities.\nDV3 I am particularly concerned about the cost relative to benefit overall for smaller and not-for-profit entities in\nthe private and public sectors, while recognising that identifying which entities are required to apply AASB S2\nis beyond the role of the AASB.\nDV4 I also have strong concerns around the requirements to disclose Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions when the\nconcepts of reporting entity control, as well as verifiability and usefulness to report users regarding allocating\nscarce resources to an entity and across entities, are not established in my view. My concerns in this regard\nare heightened for smaller and not-for-profit entities in the private and public sectors.\nDV5 While AASB S2 contains some useful terminology and concepts, most of Australia’s significant financial\nimpacts of climate-related physical and transition risks, opportunities and resilience, are (and will be) evident\nthrough existing corporate reporting and analysis mechanisms. Moreover, Australia’s large energy producers,\nconsumers and greenhouse gas emitters are already captured through mandatory National Greenhouse and\nEnergy Reporting Scheme obligations.\nDV6 A further consideration for adoption of AASB S2 in the public sector is its different role and obligations in\nrelation to climate-related financial risk. The public sector often acts as both the emergency first responder\nand the funder of last resort when adverse events occur in the community. The complexity of the circumstances\nand multitude of drivers of adversity response and recovery decisions, and therefore financial impacts, cannot\nbe reliably estimated on a whole of jurisdiction scale – therefore, I do not consider they could sensibly fit\nwithin the requirements set out in AASB S2.\nDV7 Sustainability reporting as required by the recent Corporations Act amendments and specified in AASB S2\nrepresents a profound shift and cost escalation in Australian corporate reporting. However, the practical\nbenefits of mandatory reporting in accordance with AASB S2 for users and the Australian financial system\nand environment have not yet been demonstrated or clearly articulated. When combined with acute shortages\nin reporting and auditing capability and capacity, which particularly affect smaller and not-for-profit entities\nin the private and public sectors, implementation of AASB S2 is, in my view, unworkable.\nAASB S2 58 BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS",

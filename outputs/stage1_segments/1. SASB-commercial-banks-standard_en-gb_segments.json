    "content": "Use of the Standards\nSASB Standards are intended to aid entities in disclosing information about sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital\nover the short, medium or long term. An entity determines which Industry Standard(s) and which disclosure topics are\nrelevant to its business, and which associated metrics to report. In general, an entity should use the SASB Standard\n® ®\nspecific to its primary industry as identified in SICS . However, companies with substantial business in multiple SICS\nindustries should refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics and associated metrics in additional\nSASB Standards.\nThe disclosure topics and associated metrics contained in this Standard have been identified as those that are likely\nto be useful to investors. However, the responsibility for making materiality judgements and determinations rests with\nthe reporting entity.\nIndustry Description\nCommercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations, and engage in lending to\ninfrastructure, real estate and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the\nfunctioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity.\nThe industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment and interest rates.\nThe risk from mismatched assets and liabilities further characterises the industry. The regulatory environment\ngoverning the commercial banking industry witnessed significant changes in the wake of the 2008 global financial\ncrisis and continues to evolve today. These and other regulatory trends may affect performance. Commercial banks\nwith global operations must manage new regulations in many jurisdictions that are creating regulatory uncertainty,\nparticularly regarding the consistent application of new rules.\nNote: This standard addresses ‘pure play’ commercial banking services, which may not include all the activities of\nintegrated financial institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage services, mortgage finance, consumer\nfinance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate standards address the sustainability\nissues for activities in those industries.\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS|5",

Entities that\nfail to safeguard customer data may be susceptible to decreased revenue and consumer confidence. As the growth in\nmobile banking and cloud storage continues and more bank operations become technology- and internet-dependent,\ndata security management becomes increasingly important. Sophisticated technology and continuous staff training\nare essential amid growing cybersecurity threats. The metrics for this disclosure topic focus on providing more detail\non efforts related to safeguarding data against emerging and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and\ntechnologies, and security breaches compromising customers’ information. Enhanced disclosure on management\nstrategies to address these risks may permit shareholders to understand how commercial banks are protecting\nshareholder value.\nMetrics\nFN-CB-230a.1.

Emerging\nfinancing models and technologies provide banks with an opportunity to offer products and services in previously\nunderserved markets and obtain additional sources of revenue. Entities that can meet the need to extend credit and\nfinancial services to low-income populations and small businesses while avoiding predatory and irresponsible lending\npractices may create long-term value and improve brand reputation. These services also should be complemented by\nefforts to improve financial literacy, which will assist customers in making informed decisions. By disclosing their\napproach to financial inclusion and capacity building, commercial banks can provide investors with decision-useful\ninformation for assessing banks’ ability to ensure long-term, sustainable value creation.\nMetrics\nFN-CB-240a.1.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can have material\nimplications for the underlying entities, assets and projects to which commercial banks lend across a range of\nindustries. Therefore, entities increasingly must examine ESG factors when determining the quality of collateral.\nCommercial banks also may enable positive environmental and social externalities to generate significant revenue\nstreams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks and opportunities could\nface diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should subsequently disclose how\nESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk associated with specific\nsustainability trends. Specifically, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to disclose how they address\nclimate change related risks.\nMetrics\nFN-CB-410a.2. Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social\nand governance (ESG) factors in credit analysis\n1 The entity shall describe its approach to the incorporation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors\nin its credit analysis.\n1.1 The definition of incorporation of ESG factors is aligned with that of the Global Sustainable Investment\nAlliance (GSIA) and includes the use of ESG information in the investment decision-making processes.\n1.2 Examples of ESG factors and issues are provided in the PRI Reporting Framework—Main definitions 2018,\nsection ‘ESG issues’.\n1.3 Credit analysis is defined as a method to calculate the creditworthiness of a business or organisation to\nhonour debt obligations. This method seeks to identify the appropriate level of default risk associated with\nfinancing such business, organisation or project.\n2 The scope of disclosure shall include commercial and industrial lending as well as project finance.\n3 The entity shall describe the policies that determine its approach to the incorporation of ESG factors in its credit\nanalysis.\n4 The entity shall discuss how it incorporates ESG factors when estimating credit losses over the contractual term\nof the entity’s financial assets.\n5 The entity shall describe its approach to implementation of the aspects of the entity’s ESG incorporation\npractices.\n5.1 The description shall include:\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | COMMERCIAL BANKS|14",

Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher emissions might be\nmore susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy change\nwhich in turn can impact the prospects of a financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities.\nThese risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other financial and\noperational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent\ncarbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise through related technological\nshifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects. Entities participating in commercial banking\nactivities are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This\nmeasurement serves as an indicator of an entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how it might\nneed to adapt its financial activities over time.\nMetrics\nFN-CB-410b.1.

Entities\nmust adhere to a complex and often inconsistent set of rules relating to performance and conduct, as well as provide\ndisclosure on issues including insider trading, antitrust behaviour, price fixing and market manipulation. Entities are\nsubject to strict legal requirements against tax evasion, fraud, money laundering and corrupt practices. In some\njurisdictions, enhanced rewards for whistle-blowers may increase the number of complaints brought to regulators.\nEntities that ensure regulatory compliance through robust internal controls may build trust with clients, increase\nrevenue and protect shareholder value by minimising losses incurred because of legal proceedings.\nMetrics\nFN-CB-510a.1.

Because of the interconnectedness of the global financial system, these failures can contribute to\nsignificant market disruption and financial crises. The systemic interconnectedness of financial institutions has\nbecome a central concern for regulators. As a result, many jurisdictions require that banks undergo supervised stress\ntests to evaluate whether the entity has sufficient capital reserves and liquidity to absorb losses, continue operations\nand meet obligations during adverse economic and financial conditions. Failure to meet regulatory requirements may\nlead to penalties and substantially increased future compliance costs. Commercial banks should improve their\ndisclosures by measuring how well they can absorb shocks arising from systemic stresses to demonstrate how risks\nassociated with their size, complexity, interconnectedness, substitutability and cross-jurisdictional activity are being\nmanaged. Entities that commit to enhanced disclosures may experience improved investor and shareholder\nconfidence, potentially leading to increased revenues.\nMetrics\nFN-CB-550a.1. Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) score, by category\n1 The entity shall disclose its Globally Systematically Important Bank (G-SIB) score for these categories: (1) size,\n(2) cross-jurisdictional activity, (3) interconnectedness, (4) substitutability, (5) complexity and (6) overall score.\n2 The G-SIB scores are defined by, and shall be calculated according to, the methodology established by the latest\nversion of the Bank of International Settlements’ (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Global\nsystematically important banks: updated assessment methodology and the higher loss absorbency requirement\n(BCBS assessment methodology).\n2.1 The set of indicators used in the calculation of the G-SIB score is outlined by the BCBS assessment\nmethodology in the reporting instructions and the reporting template.\n2.1.1 The entity shall refer to the reporting instructions and the reporting template for the relevant\nreporting period.\n2.2 The G-SIB score calculation is provided by the technical summary of the BCBS assessment methodology.\nThe BCBS assessment methodology further provides:\n2.2.1 denominators used for score calculation for the relevant reporting period; and\n2.2.2 the cut-off score used to identify G-SIBs, and bucket thresholds used to allocate G-SIBs to buckets\nfor the purposes of calculating the specific higher loss absorbency (HLA) requirements for each\ninstitution.\n3 The entity shall disclose the latest available G-SIB score at the time of reporting.\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | COMMERCIAL BANKS|21",

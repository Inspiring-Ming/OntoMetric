For the purposes of this Standard, these risks and opportunities are\ncollectively referred to as ‘climate-related risks and opportunities that could\nreasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects’.\nScope\n3 This Standard applies to:\n(a) climate-related risks to which the entity is exposed, which are:\n(i) climate-related physical risks; and\n(ii) climate-related transition risks; and\n(b) climate-related opportunities available to the entity.\n4 Climate-related risks and opportunities that could not reasonably be\nexpected to affect an entity’s prospects are outside the scope of this\nStandard.\nCore content\nGovernance\n5 The objective of climate-related financial disclosures on governance is to\nenable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the\ngovernance processes, controls and procedures an entity uses to monitor,\nmanage and oversee climate-related risks and opportunities.\n6 To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:\n(a) the governance body(s) (which can include a board, committee or\nequivalent body charged with governance) or individual(s) responsible\nfor oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. Specifically,\nthe entity shall identify that body(s) or individual(s) and disclose\ninformation about:\n1 Throughout this Standard, the terms ‘primary users’ and ‘users’ are used interchangeably, with\nthe same meaning.\n© IFRS Foundation 5\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\n(i) how responsibilities for climate-related risks and opportunities\nare reflected in the terms of reference, mandates, role\ndescriptions and other related policies applicable to that body(s)\nor individual(s);\n(ii) how the body(s) or individual(s) determines whether\nappropriate skills and competencies are available or will be\ndeveloped to oversee strategies designed to respond to climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities;\n(iii) how and how often the body(s) or individual(s) is informed\nabout climate-related risks and opportunities;\n(iv) how the body(s) or individual(s) takes into account climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities when overseeing the entity’s\nstrategy, its decisions on major transactions and its risk\nmanagement processes and related policies, including whether\nthe body(s) or individual(s) has considered trade-offs associated\nwith those risks and opportunities; and\n(v) how the body(s) or individual(s) oversees the setting of targets\nrelated to climate-related risks and opportunities, and monitors\nprogress towards those targets (see paragraphs 33–36),\nincluding whether and how related performance metrics are\nincluded in remuneration policies (see paragraph 29(g)).\n(b) management’s role in the governance processes, controls and\nprocedures used to monitor, manage and oversee climate-related risks\nand opportunities, including information about:\n(i) whether the role is delegated to a specific management-level\nposition or management-level committee and how oversight is\nexercised over that position or committee; and\n(ii) whether management uses controls and procedures to support\nthe oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities and, if\nso, how these controls and procedures are integrated with\nother internal functions.\n7 In preparing disclosures to fulfil the requirements in paragraph 6, an entity\nshall avoid unnecessary duplication in accordance with IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1)\n(see paragraph B42(b) of IFRS S1). For example, although an entity shall\nprovide the information required by paragraph 6, if oversight of sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities is managed on an integrated basis, the entity\nwould avoid duplication by providing integrated governance disclosures\ninstead of separate disclosures for each sustainability-related risk and\nopportunity.\n6 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nStrategy\n8 The objective of climate-related financial disclosures on strategy is to\nenable users of general purpose financial reports to understand an entity’s\nstrategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n9 Specifically, an entity shall disclose information to enable users of general\npurpose financial reports to understand:\n(a) the climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be\nexpected to affect the entity’s prospects (see paragraphs 10–12);\n(b) the current and anticipated effects of those climate-related risks and\nopportunities on the entity’s business model and value chain (see\nparagraph 13);\n(c) the effects of those climate-related risks and opportunities on the\nentity’s strategy and decision-making, including information about its\nclimate-related transition plan (see paragraph 14);\n(d) the effects of those climate-related risks and opportunities on the\nentity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows for\nthe reporting period, and their anticipated effects on the entity’s\nfinancial position, financial performance and cash flows over the\nshort, medium and long term, taking into consideration how those\nclimate-related risks and opportunities have been factored into the\nentity’s financial planning (see paragraphs 15–21); and\n(e) the climate resilience of the entity’s strategy and its business model to\nclimate-related changes, developments and uncertainties, taking into\nconsideration the entity’s identified climate-related risks and\nopportunities (see paragraph 22).\nClimate-related risks and opportunities\n10 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose\nfinancial reports to understand the climate-related risks and opportunities\nthat could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects. Specifically,\nthe entity shall:\n(a) describe climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably\nbe expected to affect the entity’s prospects;\n(b) explain, for each climate-related risk the entity has identified, whether\nthe entity considers the risk to be a climate-related physical risk or\nclimate-related transition risk;\n(c) specify, for each climate-related risk and opportunity the entity has\nidentified, over which time horizons—short, medium or long term—\nthe effects of each climate-related risk and opportunity could\nreasonably be expected to occur; and\n(d) explain how the entity defines ‘short term’, ‘medium term’ and ‘long\nterm’ and how these definitions are linked to the planning horizons\nused by the entity for strategic decision-making.\n© IFRS Foundation 7",

Climate resilience involves the\ncapacity to manage climate-related risks and benefit from\nclimate-related opportunities, including the ability to respond\nand adapt to climate-related transition risks and climate-\nrelated physical risks. An entity’s climate resilience includes\nboth its strategic resilience and its operational resilience to\nclimate-related changes, developments and uncertainties.\nclimate-related Risks resulting from climate change that can be event-driven\nphysical risks (acute physical risk) or from longer-term shifts in climatic\npatterns (chronic physical risk). Acute physical risks arise from\nweather-related events such as storms, floods, drought or\nheatwaves, which are increasing in severity and frequency.\nChronic physical risks arise from longer-term shifts in climatic\npatterns including changes in precipitation and temperature\nwhich could lead to sea level rise, reduced water availability,\nbiodiversity loss and changes in soil productivity.\nThese risks could carry financial implications for an entity,\nsuch as costs resulting from direct damage to assets or indirect\neffects of supply-chain disruption. The entity's financial\nperformance could also be affected by changes in water\navailability, sourcing and quality; and extreme temperature\nchanges affecting the entity's premises, operations, supply\nchains, transportation needs and employee health and safety.\nclimate-related risks Climate-related risks refers to the potential negative effects of\nand opportunities climate change on an entity. These risks are categorised as\nclimate-related physical risks and climate-related transition\nrisks.\nClimate-related opportunities refers to the potential positive\neffects arising from climate change for an entity. Efforts to\nmitigate and adapt to climate change can produce climate-\nrelated opportunities for an entity.\nclimate-related An aspect of an entity’s overall strategy that lays out the\ntransition plan entity’s targets, actions or resources for its transition towards a\nlower-carbon economy, including actions such as reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n© IFRS Foundation 19\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nclimate-related Risks that arise from efforts to transition to a lower-carbon\ntransition risks economy.

    "content": "IFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nAppendix B\nApplication guidance\nThis appendix is an integral part of IFRS S2 and has the same authority as the other parts of the\nStandard.\nClimate resilience (paragraph 22)\nB1 Paragraph 22 requires an entity to use climate-related scenario analysis to\nassess its climate resilience, using an approach that is commensurate with its\ncircumstances.2 The entity is required to use an approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis that enables it to consider all reasonable and supportable\ninformation that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue\ncost or effort. Paragraphs B2–B18 provide guidance on how an entity uses\nscenario analysis to assess the entity’s climate resilience. Specifically:\n(a) paragraphs B2–B7 set out the factors the entity shall consider when\nassessing its circumstances;\n(b) paragraphs B8–B15 set out the factors the entity shall consider when\ndetermining an appropriate approach to climate-related scenario\nanalysis; and\n(c) paragraphs B16–B18 set out additional factors for the entity to\nconsider when determining its approach to climate-related scenario\nanalysis over time.\nAssessing the circumstances\nB2 An entity shall use an approach to climate-related scenario analysis that is\ncommensurate with its circumstances as at the time the entity carries out its\nclimate-related scenario analysis (see paragraph B3). To assess its\ncircumstances the entity shall consider:\n(a) the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see\nparagraphs B4–B5); and\n(b) the skills, capabilities and resources available to the entity for the\nclimate-related scenario analysis (see paragraphs B6–B7).\nB3 An entity shall assess its circumstances each time it carries out its climate-\nrelated scenario analysis. For example, an entity that carries out its climate-\nrelated scenario analysis every three years to align with its strategic planning\ncycle (see paragraph B18) would be required to reconsider for this purpose its\nexposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities\nand resources available at that time.\n2 This application guidance (paragraphs B1–B18) draws on the range of practice outlined in\ndocuments published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD),\nincluding Technical Supplement: The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-related Risks and\nOpportunities (2017) and Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies (2020).\n24 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nExposure to climate-related risks and opportunities\nB4 An entity shall consider its exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities\nin its assessment of its circumstances and when determining the approach to\nuse for its climate-related scenario analysis. This consideration provides\nessential context for understanding the potential benefits of using a particular\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has a\nhigh degree of exposure to climate-related risk then a more quantitative or\ntechnically sophisticated approach to climate-related scenario analysis would\nbe of greater benefit to the entity and users of general purpose financial\nreports. Users of general purpose financial reports would be less likely to\nbenefit from quantitative or technically sophisticated climate-related scenario\nanalysis if the entity is exposed to few or relatively less severe climate-related\nrisks and opportunities. This means that—with all else being equal—the\ngreater the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks or opportunities, the\nmore likely it is the entity would determine that a more technically\nsophisticated form of climate-related scenario analysis is required.\nB5 This Standard requires an entity to identify the climate-related risks and\nopportunities to which it is exposed (see paragraph 10) and to disclose\ninformation about the process the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and\nmonitor those risks and opportunities (see paragraph 25). The information the\nentity discloses in accordance with paragraphs 10 and 25 can inform the\nentity’s consideration of its exposure to climate-related risks and\nopportunities.\nSkills, capabilities and resources available\nB6 An entity shall consider the available skills, capabilities and resources when\ndetermining an appropriate approach to use for its climate-related scenario\nanalysis. These skills, capabilities and resources might include both internal\nand external skills, capabilities and resources. The entity’s available skills,\ncapabilities and resources provide context to inform its consideration of the\npotential cost and level of effort required by a particular approach to climate-\nrelated scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has only just begun to\nexplore the use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess its climate\nresilience, it might be unable to use a quantitative or technically sophisticated\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis without undue cost or effort. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, if resources are available to the entity then it will be\nable to invest in obtaining or developing the necessary skills and capabilities.\nB7 Climate-related scenario analysis can be resource intensive and might—\nthrough an iterative learning process—be developed and refined over multiple\nplanning cycles. As an entity repeats the climate-related scenario analysis, it is\nlikely to develop skills and capabilities that will enable the entity to\nstrengthen its approach to climate-related scenario analysis over time. For\nexample, if an entity has not yet used climate-related scenario analysis or\nparticipates in an industry where climate-related scenario analysis is not\ncommonly used, the entity might need more time to develop its skills and\ncapabilities. In contrast, an entity in an industry where climate-related\nscenario analysis is established practice—such as extractives and mineral\n© IFRS Foundation 25\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nprocessing—would be expected to have strengthened its skills and capabilities\nthrough its experience.\nDetermining the appropriate approach\nB8 An entity shall determine an approach to climate-related scenario analysis\nthat enables it to consider all reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The\ndetermination of the approach shall be informed by the assessments of the\nentity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs\nB4–B5) and its available skills, capabilities and resources (see paragraphs\nB6–B7). Making such a determination involves:\n(a) selecting inputs to the climate-related scenario analysis (see\nparagraphs B11–B13); and\n(b) making analytical choices about how to carry out the climate-related\nscenario analysis (see paragraphs B14–B15).\nB9 Reasonable and supportable information includes information about past\nevents, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. It also includes\nquantitative or qualitative information, and information that is obtained from\nan external source or owned or developed internally.\nB10 An entity will need to use judgement to determine the mix of inputs and\nanalytical choices that will enable the entity to consider all reasonable and\nsupportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date\nwithout undue cost or effort. The degree of judgement that is required\ndepends on the availability of detailed information. As the time horizon\nincreases and the availability of detailed information decreases, the degree of\njudgement required increases.\nSelecting inputs\nB11 When an entity selects the inputs to use in its climate-related scenario\nanalysis, the entity shall consider all reasonable and supportable information\n—including scenarios, variables and other inputs—available to the entity at\nthe reporting date without undue cost or effort. The inputs used in scenario\nanalysis might include information that is qualitative or quantitative, and is\nobtained from an external source or developed internally. For example,\npublicly available climate-related scenarios—from authoritative sources—that\ndescribe future trends and a range of pathways to plausible outcomes are\nconsidered to be available to the entity without undue cost or effort.\nB12 When selecting scenarios, variables and other inputs to use in climate-related\nscenario analysis, an entity might, for example, use one or more climate-\nrelated scenarios—including international and regional scenarios—that are\npublicly and freely available from authoritative sources. The entity shall have\na reasonable and supportable basis for using a particular scenario or set of\nscenarios. For example, an entity with operations concentrated in a\njurisdiction where emissions are regulated—or are likely to be regulated in\nthe future—might determine that it is appropriate to carry out its analysis\nusing a scenario consistent with an orderly transition to a lower-carbon\n26 © IFRS Foundation",

Climate resilience involves the\ncapacity to manage climate-related risks and benefit from\nclimate-related opportunities, including the ability to respond\nand adapt to climate-related transition risks and climate-\nrelated physical risks. An entity’s climate resilience includes\nboth its strategic resilience and its operational resilience to\nclimate-related changes, developments and uncertainties.\nclimate-related Risks resulting from climate change that can be event-driven\nphysical risks (acute physical risk) or from longer-term shifts in climatic\npatterns (chronic physical risk). Acute physical risks arise from\nweather-related events such as storms, floods, drought or\nheatwaves, which are increasing in severity and frequency.\nChronic physical risks arise from longer-term shifts in climatic\npatterns including changes in precipitation and temperature\nwhich could lead to sea level rise, reduced water availability,\nbiodiversity loss and changes in soil productivity.\nThese risks could carry financial implications for an entity,\nsuch as costs resulting from direct damage to assets or indirect\neffects of supply-chain disruption. The entity's financial\nperformance could also be affected by changes in water\navailability, sourcing and quality; and extreme temperature\nchanges affecting the entity's premises, operations, supply\nchains, transportation needs and employee health and safety.\nclimate-related risks Climate-related risks refers to the potential negative effects of\nand opportunities climate change on an entity. These risks are categorised as\nclimate-related physical risks and climate-related transition\nrisks.\nClimate-related opportunities refers to the potential positive\neffects arising from climate change for an entity. Efforts to\nmitigate and adapt to climate change can produce climate-\nrelated opportunities for an entity.\nclimate-related An aspect of an entity’s overall strategy that lays out the\ntransition plan entity’s targets, actions or resources for its transition towards a\nlower-carbon economy, including actions such as reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n© IFRS Foundation 19\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nclimate-related Risks that arise from efforts to transition to a lower-carbon\ntransition risks economy. Transition risks include policy, legal, technological,\nmarket and reputational risks.

Paragraphs B2–B18 provide guidance on how an entity uses\nscenario analysis to assess the entity’s climate resilience. Specifically:\n(a) paragraphs B2–B7 set out the factors the entity shall consider when\nassessing its circumstances;\n(b) paragraphs B8–B15 set out the factors the entity shall consider when\ndetermining an appropriate approach to climate-related scenario\nanalysis; and\n(c) paragraphs B16–B18 set out additional factors for the entity to\nconsider when determining its approach to climate-related scenario\nanalysis over time.\nAssessing the circumstances\nB2 An entity shall use an approach to climate-related scenario analysis that is\ncommensurate with its circumstances as at the time the entity carries out its\nclimate-related scenario analysis (see paragraph B3). To assess its\ncircumstances the entity shall consider:\n(a) the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see\nparagraphs B4–B5); and\n(b) the skills, capabilities and resources available to the entity for the\nclimate-related scenario analysis (see paragraphs B6–B7).\nB3 An entity shall assess its circumstances each time it carries out its climate-\nrelated scenario analysis. For example, an entity that carries out its climate-\nrelated scenario analysis every three years to align with its strategic planning\ncycle (see paragraph B18) would be required to reconsider for this purpose its\nexposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities\nand resources available at that time.\n2 This application guidance (paragraphs B1–B18) draws on the range of practice outlined in\ndocuments published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD),\nincluding Technical Supplement: The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-related Risks and\nOpportunities (2017) and Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies (2020).\n24 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nExposure to climate-related risks and opportunities\nB4 An entity shall consider its exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities\nin its assessment of its circumstances and when determining the approach to\nuse for its climate-related scenario analysis. This consideration provides\nessential context for understanding the potential benefits of using a particular\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has a\nhigh degree of exposure to climate-related risk then a more quantitative or\ntechnically sophisticated approach to climate-related scenario analysis would\nbe of greater benefit to the entity and users of general purpose financial\nreports. Users of general purpose financial reports would be less likely to\nbenefit from quantitative or technically sophisticated climate-related scenario\nanalysis if the entity is exposed to few or relatively less severe climate-related\nrisks and opportunities. This means that—with all else being equal—the\ngreater the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks or opportunities, the\nmore likely it is the entity would determine that a more technically\nsophisticated form of climate-related scenario analysis is required.\nB5 This Standard requires an entity to identify the climate-related risks and\nopportunities to which it is exposed (see paragraph 10) and to disclose\ninformation about the process the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and\nmonitor those risks and opportunities (see paragraph 25). The information the\nentity discloses in accordance with paragraphs 10 and 25 can inform the\nentity’s consideration of its exposure to climate-related risks and\nopportunities.\nSkills, capabilities and resources available\nB6 An entity shall consider the available skills, capabilities and resources when\ndetermining an appropriate approach to use for its climate-related scenario\nanalysis. These skills, capabilities and resources might include both internal\nand external skills, capabilities and resources. The entity’s available skills,\ncapabilities and resources provide context to inform its consideration of the\npotential cost and level of effort required by a particular approach to climate-\nrelated scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has only just begun to\nexplore the use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess its climate\nresilience, it might be unable to use a quantitative or technically sophisticated\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis without undue cost or effort. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, if resources are available to the entity then it will be\nable to invest in obtaining or developing the necessary skills and capabilities.\nB7 Climate-related scenario analysis can be resource intensive and might—\nthrough an iterative learning process—be developed and refined over multiple\nplanning cycles. As an entity repeats the climate-related scenario analysis, it is\nlikely to develop skills and capabilities that will enable the entity to\nstrengthen its approach to climate-related scenario analysis over time. For\nexample, if an entity has not yet used climate-related scenario analysis or\nparticipates in an industry where climate-related scenario analysis is not\ncommonly used, the entity might need more time to develop its skills and\ncapabilities. In contrast, an entity in an industry where climate-related\nscenario analysis is established practice—such as extractives and mineral\n© IFRS Foundation 25\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nprocessing—would be expected to have strengthened its skills and capabilities\nthrough its experience.\nDetermining the appropriate approach\nB8 An entity shall determine an approach to climate-related scenario analysis\nthat enables it to consider all reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The\ndetermination of the approach shall be informed by the assessments of the\nentity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs\nB4–B5) and its available skills, capabilities and resources (see paragraphs\nB6–B7). Making such a determination involves:\n(a) selecting inputs to the climate-related scenario analysis (see\nparagraphs B11–B13); and\n(b) making analytical choices about how to carry out the climate-related\nscenario analysis (see paragraphs B14–B15).\nB9 Reasonable and supportable information includes information about past\nevents, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. It also includes\nquantitative or qualitative information, and information that is obtained from\nan external source or owned or developed internally.\nB10 An entity will need to use judgement to determine the mix of inputs and\nanalytical choices that will enable the entity to consider all reasonable and\nsupportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date\nwithout undue cost or effort. The degree of judgement that is required\ndepends on the availability of detailed information. As the time horizon\nincreases and the availability of detailed information decreases, the degree of\njudgement required increases.\nSelecting inputs\nB11 When an entity selects the inputs to use in its climate-related scenario\nanalysis, the entity shall consider all reasonable and supportable information\n—including scenarios, variables and other inputs—available to the entity at\nthe reporting date without undue cost or effort. The inputs used in scenario\nanalysis might include information that is qualitative or quantitative, and is\nobtained from an external source or developed internally. For example,\npublicly available climate-related scenarios—from authoritative sources—that\ndescribe future trends and a range of pathways to plausible outcomes are\nconsidered to be available to the entity without undue cost or effort.\nB12 When selecting scenarios, variables and other inputs to use in climate-related\nscenario analysis, an entity might, for example, use one or more climate-\nrelated scenarios—including international and regional scenarios—that are\npublicly and freely available from authoritative sources. The entity shall have\na reasonable and supportable basis for using a particular scenario or set of\nscenarios. For example, an entity with operations concentrated in a\njurisdiction where emissions are regulated—or are likely to be regulated in\nthe future—might determine that it is appropriate to carry out its analysis\nusing a scenario consistent with an orderly transition to a lower-carbon\n26 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\neconomy or consistent with relevant jurisdictional commitments to the latest\ninternational agreement on climate change. Elsewhere, for example, an entity\nwith heightened exposure to physical climate-related risks might determine\nthat it is appropriate to carry out its analysis using a localised climate-related\nscenario that takes into account current policies.\nB13 In considering whether the selected inputs are reasonable and supportable, an\nentity shall consider the objective of paragraph 22, which requires the entity\nto disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports\nto understand the resilience of the entity’s strategy and business model to\nclimate-related changes, developments and uncertainties, taking into\nconsideration the entity’s identified climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThis means that the inputs to the entity’s climate-related scenario analysis\nshall be relevant to the entity’s circumstances, for example, to the particular\nactivities the entity undertakes and the geographical location of those\nactivities.\nMaking analytical choices\nB14 An entity’s resilience assessment will be informed not only by the individual\ninputs to its climate-related scenario analysis, but also by the information it\ndevelops in combining those inputs to carry out the analysis. The entity shall\nprioritise the analytical choices (for example, whether to use qualitative\nanalysis or quantitative modelling) that will enable it to consider all\nreasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the\nreporting date without undue cost or effort. For example, if an entity is able—\nwithout undue cost or effort—to incorporate multiple carbon price pathways\nassociated with a given outcome (for example, a 1.5 degree Celsius outcome),\nthis analysis is likely to strengthen the entity’s resilience assessment,\nassuming such an approach is warranted by the entity’s risk exposure.\nB15 Quantitative information will often enable an entity to carry out a more\nrobust assessment of its climate resilience. However, qualitative information\n(including scenario narratives), either alone or combined with quantitative\ndata, can also provide a reasonable and supportable basis for the entity’s\nresilience assessment.\nAdditional considerations\nB16 Climate-related scenario analysis is an evolving practice and, therefore, the\napproach that an entity uses is likely to change over time. As described in\nparagraphs B2–B7, the entity shall determine its approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis based on its particular circumstances, including the entity’s\nexposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities\nand resources available for the scenario analysis. Those circumstances are also\nlikely to change over time. Therefore, the entity’s approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis need not be the same from one reporting period or strategic\nplanning cycle to the next (see paragraph B18).\n© IFRS Foundation 27\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nB17 An entity might use a simpler approach to climate-related scenario analysis,\nsuch as qualitative scenario narratives, if such an approach is appropriate to\nthe entity’s circumstances. For example, if an entity does not currently have\nthe skills, capabilities or resources to carry out quantitative climate-related\nscenario analysis but has a high degree of exposure to climate-related risk, the\nentity might initially use a simpler approach to climate-related scenario\nanalysis, but would build its capabilities through experience and, therefore,\nwould apply a more advanced quantitative approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis over time. An entity with a high degree of exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities, and with access to the necessary skills,\ncapabilities or resources, is required to apply a more advanced quantitative\napproach to climate-related scenario analysis.\nB18 Although paragraph 22 requires an entity to disclose information about its\nclimate resilience at each reporting date, the entity might carry out its\nclimate-related scenario analysis in line with its strategic planning cycle,\nincluding a multi-year strategic planning cycle (for example, every three to\nfive years). Therefore, in some reporting periods the entity’s disclosures in\naccordance with paragraph 22(b) could remain unchanged from the previous\nreporting period if the entity does not conduct a scenario analysis annually.\nThe entity shall—at a minimum—update its climate-related scenario analysis\nin line with its strategic planning cycle. However, an assessment of the entity’s\nresilience is required to be carried out annually to reflect updated insight into\nthe implications of climate uncertainty for the entity’s business model and\nstrategy. As such, an entity’s disclosure in accordance with paragraph 22(a)—\nthat is, the results of the entity’s resilience assessment—shall be updated at\neach reporting period.\n28 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nGreenhouse gases (paragraph 29(a))\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nPermission to use information from a reporting period that is\ndifferent from the entity’s reporting period, in specific\ncircumstances\nB19 An entity might have a different reporting period from some or all of the\nentities in its value chain. Such a difference would mean that greenhouse gas\nemissions information from these entities in its value chain for the entity’s\nreporting period might not be readily available for the entity to use for its own\ndisclosure. In such circumstances, the entity is permitted to measure its\ngreenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(i) using\ninformation for reporting periods that are different from its own reporting\nperiod if that information is obtained from entities in its value chain with\nreporting periods that are different from the entity’s reporting period, on the\ncondition that:\n(a) the entity uses the most recent data available from those entities in its\nvalue chain without undue cost or effort to measure and disclose its\ngreenhouse gas emissions;\n(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and\n(c) the entity discloses the effects of significant events and changes in\ncircumstances (relevant to its greenhouse gas emissions) that occur\nbetween the reporting dates of the entities in its value chain and the\ndate of the entity’s general purpose financial reports.\nAggregation of greenhouse gases into CO equivalent using global\nwarming potential values\nB20 Paragraph 29(a) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross greenhouse gas\nemissions generated during the reporting period, expressed as metric tonnes\nof CO equivalent. To meet this requirement, the entity shall aggregate the\nseven constituent greenhouse gases into CO equivalent values.\nB21 If an entity uses direct measurement to measure its greenhouse gas emissions,\nthe entity is required to convert the seven constituent greenhouse gases into a\nCO equivalent value using global warming potential values based on a 100-\nyear time horizon, from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange assessment available at the reporting date.\nB22 If an entity uses emission factors to estimate its greenhouse gas emissions, the\nentity shall use—as its basis for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions—the\nemission factors that best represent the entity’s activity (see paragraph B29). If\nthese emission factors have already converted the constituent gases into CO\nequivalent values, the entity is not required to recalculate the emission factors\nusing global warming potential values based on a 100-year time horizon from\nthe latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment available at\nthe reporting date. However, if an entity uses emission factors that are not\n© IFRS Foundation 29\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nconverted into CO equivalent values, then the entity shall use the global\nwarming potential values based on a 100-year time horizon from the latest\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment available at the\nreporting date.\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol\nB23 Paragraph 29(a)(ii) requires an entity to disclose its greenhouse gas emissions\nmeasured in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate\nAccounting and Reporting Standard (2004). For the avoidance of doubt, an\nentity shall apply the requirements in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A\nCorporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) only to the extent that\nthey do not conflict with the requirements in this Standard. For example, the\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\n(2004) does not require an entity to disclose its Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions, however, the entity is required to disclose Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a).\nB24 An entity is required to use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate\nAccounting and Reporting Standard (2004) unless the entity is required by a\njurisdictional authority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a different\nmethod for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. If the entity is required\nby a jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a\ndifferent method for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is\npermitted to use this method rather than using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol:\nA Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) for as long as the\njurisdictional or exchange requirement applies to the entity.\nB25 In some circumstances, an entity might be subject to a requirement in the\njurisdiction in which it operates to disclose its greenhouse gas emissions for a\nspecific part of the entity or for some of its greenhouse gas emissions (for\nexample, only for Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions). In such\ncircumstances, the jurisdictional requirement does not exempt the entity\nfrom applying the requirements in this Standard to disclose the entity’s Scope\n1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for the entity as a whole.\nMeasurement approach, inputs and assumptions\nB26 Paragraph 29(a)(iii) requires an entity to disclose the measurement approach,\ninputs and assumptions it uses to measure its greenhouse gas emissions. As\npart of this requirement, the entity shall include information about:\n(a) the measurement approach the entity uses in accordance with the\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting\nStandard (2004) (see paragraph B27);\n(b) the applicable method if the entity is not using the Greenhouse Gas\nProtocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) and\nthe measurement approach the entity uses (see paragraph B28); and\n(c) the emission factors the entity uses (see paragraph B29).\n30 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nThe measurement approach set out in the Greenhouse Gas\nProtocol\nB27 The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting\nStandard (2004) includes different measurement approaches that an entity\nmight use when measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. In disclosing\ninformation in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii), the entity is required to\ndisclose information about the measurement approach it uses. For example,\nwhen the entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured in\naccordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and\nReporting Standard (2004), the entity is required to use the equity share or\ncontrol approach. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:\n(a) the approach it uses to determine its greenhouse gas emissions (for\nexample, the equity share or control approach in the Greenhouse Gas\nProtocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004)); and\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity’s choice of measurement\napproach and how that approach relates to the disclosure objective in\nparagraph 27.\nOther methods and measurement approaches\nB28 When an entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured in\naccordance with another method, applying paragraphs 29(a)(ii), B24–B25 or\nC4(a), the entity shall disclose:\n(a) the applicable method and measurement approach the entity uses to\ndetermine its greenhouse gas emissions; and\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity’s choice of method and\nmeasurement approach and how that approach relates to the\ndisclosure objective in paragraph 27.\nEmission factors\nB29 As part of an entity’s disclosure of the measurement approach, inputs and\nassumptions, the entity shall disclose information to enable users of general\npurpose financial reports to understand which emission factors the entity uses\nin its measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions. This Standard does not\nspecify emission factors an entity is required to use in its measurement of its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Instead, this Standard requires an entity to use\nemission factors that best represent the entity’s activity as its basis for\nmeasuring its greenhouse gas emissions.\nScope 2 greenhouse gas emissions\nB30 Paragraph 29(a)(v) requires an entity to disclose its location-based Scope 2\ngreenhouse gas emissions and provide information about any contractual\ninstruments the entity has entered into that could inform users’\nunderstanding of the entity’s Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. For the\navoidance of doubt, an entity is required to disclose its Scope 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions using a location-based approach and is required to provide\ninformation about contractual instruments only if such instruments exist and\n© IFRS Foundation 31\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\ninformation about them informs users’ understanding of an entity’s Scope 2\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nB31 Contractual instruments are any type of contract between an entity and\nanother party for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes\nabout the energy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims\n(unbundled energy attribute claims relate to the sale and purchase of energy\nthat is separate and distinct from the greenhouse gas attribute contractual\ninstruments). Various types of contractual instruments are available in\ndifferent markets and the entity might disclose information about its market-\nbased Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions as part of its disclosure.\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nB32 In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), an entity shall disclose information\nabout its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions to enable users of general purpose\nfinancial reports to understand the source of these emissions. The entity shall\nconsider its entire value chain (upstream and downstream) and shall consider\nall 15 categories of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, as described in the\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and\nReporting Standard (2011). In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), the entity\nshall disclose which of these categories are included in its Scope 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions disclosures.\nB33 For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the method an entity uses to\nmeasure its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is required to disclose the\ncategories included within its measure of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions as\ndescribed in paragraph 29(a)(vi)(1).\nB34 In accordance with paragraph B11 in IFRS S1, on the occurrence of a\nsignificant event or a significant change in circumstances, an entity shall\nreassess the scope of all affected climate-related risks and opportunities\nthroughout its value chain, including reassessing which Scope 3 categories\nand entities throughout its value chain to include in the measurement of its\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. A significant event or significant change in\ncircumstances can occur without the entity being involved in that event or\nchange in circumstances or as a result of a change in what the entity assesses\nto be important to users of general purpose financial reports. For example,\nsuch significant events or significant changes in circumstances might include:\n(a) a significant change in the entity's value chain (for example, a supplier\nin the entity's value chain makes a change that significantly alters the\nsupplier’s greenhouse gas emissions);\n(b) a significant change in the entity’s business model, activities or\ncorporate structure (for example, a merger or acquisition that expands\nthe entity's value chain); and\n(c) a significant change in the entity’s exposure to climate-related risks\nand opportunities (for example, a supplier in the entity’s value chain is\naffected by the introduction of an emissions regulation that the entity\nhad not anticipated).\n32 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nB35 An entity is permitted, but not required, to reassess the scope of any climate-\nrelated risk or opportunity throughout its value chain more frequently than\nrequired by paragraph B11 in IFRS S1.\nB36 In accordance with paragraph B6(b) in IFRS S1, to determine the scope of the\nvalue chain, which includes its breadth and composition, an entity shall use\nall reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at\nthe reporting date without undue cost or effort.\nB37 An entity that participates in one or more financial activities associated with\nasset management, commercial banking and insurance shall disclose\nadditional information about the financed emissions associated with those\nactivities as part of the entity’s disclosure of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions (see paragraphs B58–B63).\nScope 3 measurement framework\nB38 An entity’s measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is likely to\ninclude the use of estimation rather than solely comprising direct\nmeasurement. In measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions an entity shall\nuse a measurement approach, inputs and assumptions that result in a faithful\nrepresentation of this measurement. The measurement framework described\nin paragraphs B40–B54 provides guidance for an entity to use in preparing its\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.\nB39 An entity is required to use all reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort when\nthe entity selects the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it uses\nin measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB40 An entity’s measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions relies upon a\nrange of inputs. This Standard does not specify the inputs the entity is\nrequired to use to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, but does\nrequire the entity to prioritise inputs and assumptions using these identifying\ncharacteristics (which are listed in no particular order):\n(a) data based on direct measurement (paragraphs B43–B45);\n(b) data from specific activities within the entity’s value chain (paragraphs\nB46–B49);\n(c) timely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the\ntechnology used for, the value chain activity and its greenhouse gas\nemissions (paragraphs B50–B52); and\n(d) data that has been verified (paragraphs B53–B54).\nB41 An entity is required to apply the Scope 3 measurement framework to\nprioritise inputs and assumptions even when the entity is required by a\njurisdictional authority or an exchange on which the entity is listed to use a\nmethod other than the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and\nReporting Standard (2004) for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions (see\nparagraphs B24–B25), or whether the entity uses the transition relief described\nin paragraph C4(a).\n© IFRS Foundation 33\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nB42 An entity’s prioritisation of the measurement approach, inputs and\nassumptions and the entity’s considerations of associated trade-offs—based on\nthe characteristics in paragraph B40—requires management to apply\njudgement. For example, an entity might need to consider the trade-offs\nbetween timely data and data that is more representative of the jurisdiction\nand technology used for the value chain activity and its emissions. More\nrecent data might provide less detail about the specific activity, including the\ntechnology that was used in the value chain and the location of that activity.\nOn the other hand, older data that is published infrequently might be\nconsidered more representative of the specific activity and its greenhouse gas\nemissions.\nData based on direct measurement\nB43 Two methods are used to quantify Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions: direct\nmeasurement and estimation. Of these two methods—and with all else being\nequal—an entity shall prioritise direct measurement.\nB44 ‘Direct measurement’ refers to the direct monitoring of greenhouse gas\nemissions and, in theory, provides the most accurate evidence. However, it is\nexpected that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data will include estimation\ndue to the challenges associated with direct measurement of Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nB45 Estimation of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions involves approximate\ncalculations of data based on assumptions and appropriate inputs. An entity\nthat measures its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions using estimation is likely\nto use two types of input:\n(a) data that represents the entity’s activity that results in greenhouse gas\nemissions (activity data). For example, the entity might use distance\ntravelled as activity data to represent the transport of goods within its\nvalue chain.\n(b) emission factors that convert activity data into greenhouse gas\nemissions. For example, the entity will convert the distance travelled\n(activity data) into greenhouse gas emissions data using emission\nfactors.\nData from specific activities within the entity’s value chain\nB46 An entity’s measurement of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will be based\non data obtained directly from specific activities within the entity’s value\nchain (primary data), data not obtained directly from activities within the\nentity’s value chain (secondary data), or a combination of both.\nB47 In measuring an entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, primary data is\nmore likely to be representative of the entity’s value chain activity and its\ngreenhouse gas emissions than secondary data. Therefore, the entity shall\nprioritise—with all else being equal—the use of primary data.\n34 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nB48 Primary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions includes data provided by\nsuppliers or other entities in the value chain related to specific activities in an\nentity’s value chain. For example, primary data could be sourced from meter\nreadings, utility bills or other methods that represent specific activities in the\nentity’s value chain. Primary data could be collected internally (for example,\nthrough the entity’s own records), or externally from suppliers and other\nvalue chain partners (for example, supplier-specific emission factors for\npurchased goods or services). Data from specific activities within an entity’s\nvalue chain provides a more accurate representation of the entity’s specific\nvalue chain activities and, therefore, will provide a better basis for measuring\nthe entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nB49 Secondary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is data that is not\nobtained directly from specific activities within an entity’s value chain.\nSecondary data is often supplied by third-party data providers and includes\nindustry-average data (for example, from published databases, government\nstatistics, literature studies and industry associations). Secondary data\nincludes data used to approximate the activity or emission factors.\nAdditionally, secondary data includes primary data from a specific activity\n(proxy data) used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions for another activity. If\nan entity uses secondary data to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions, it shall consider the extent to which the data faithfully represents\nthe entity’s activities.\nTimely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the\ntechnology used for, the value chain activity and its greenhouse gas\nemissions\nB50 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise the use of activity or\nemissions data that is based on, or represents, the technology used in the\nvalue chain activity the data is intended to represent. For example, an entity\nmight obtain primary data from its activities (for example, the specific aircraft\nmodel, distance travelled and travel-class used by employees when travelling)\nand would then use secondary data that represents the greenhouse gas\nemissions arising from those activities to convert the primary data into an\nestimate of its greenhouse gas emissions from air travel.\nB51 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data\nthat is based on, or represents, the jurisdiction in which the activity\nhappened. For example, an entity shall prioritise emission factors that relate\nto the jurisdiction in which the entity operates or in which the activity has\ntaken place.\nB52 If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data\nthat is timely and representative of the entity’s value chain activity during the\nreporting period. In some jurisdictions, and for some technologies, secondary\ndata is collected annually and, therefore, the data is likely to be representative\nof the entity’s current practice. However, some secondary data sources rely on\ninformation collected in a reporting period that is different from the entity’s\nown reporting period.\n© IFRS Foundation 35\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nVerified data\nB53 An entity shall prioritise Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data that is\nverified. Verification can provide users of general purpose financial reports\nwith confidence that the information is complete, neutral and accurate.\nB54 Verified data might include data that has been internally or externally\nverified. Verification can take place in several ways, including on-site\nchecking, reviewing calculations, or cross-checking of data against other\nsources. However, in some cases an entity might be unable to verify its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions without undue cost or effort. For example, the\nentity might be prevented from obtaining a complete set of verified data due\nto the volume of data or because the data is obtained from entities in the\nvalue chain that are separated by many tiers from the reporting entity, that is,\nentities that the reporting entity does not interact with directly. In such cases,\nan entity might need to use unverified data.\nDisclosure of inputs to Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\nB55 An entity shall disclose information about the measurement approach, inputs\nand assumptions it uses to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in\naccordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii). This disclosure shall include information\nabout the characteristics of the data inputs as described in paragraph B40. The\npurpose of this disclosure is to provide users of general purpose financial\nreports with information about how the entity has prioritised the highest\nquality data available, which faithfully represents the value chain activity and\nits Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. This disclosure also helps users of\ngeneral purpose financial reports to understand why the measurement\napproach, inputs and assumptions the entity uses to estimate its Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions are relevant.\nB56 As part of the requirement in paragraph 29(a)(iii), and to reflect how an entity\nprioritises Scope 3 data in accordance with the measurement framework set\nout in paragraphs B40–B54, the entity shall disclose information that enables\nusers of general purpose financial reports to understand:\n(a) the extent to which the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are\nmeasured using inputs from specific activities within the entity’s value\nchain; and\n(b) the extent to which the entity’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are\nmeasured using inputs that are verified.\nB57 This Standard includes the presumption that Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions can be estimated reliably using secondary data and industry\naverages. In those rare cases when an entity determines it is impracticable to\nestimate its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, the entity shall disclose how it\nis managing its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Applying a requirement is\nimpracticable when the entity cannot apply it after making every reasonable\neffort to do so.\n36 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nFinanced emissions\nB58 Entities participating in financial activities face risks and opportunities related\nto the greenhouse gas emissions associated with those activities.\nCounterparties, borrowers or investees with higher greenhouse gas emissions\nmight be susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in\nsupply and demand and policy change, which in turn can affect the financial\ninstitution that is providing financial services to these entities. These risks and\nopportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational\nrisk and other financial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might\narise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent carbon\ntaxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise\nthrough technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing\nfossil-fuel projects. Entities participating in financial activities, including\ncommercial and investment banks, asset managers and insurance entities, are\nincreasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed\nemissions. This measurement serves as an indicator of an entity’s exposure to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities and how the entity might need to\nadapt its financial activities over time.\nB59 Paragraph 29 (a)(i)(3) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross Scope 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions generated during the reporting period, including\nupstream and downstream emissions. An entity that participates in one or\nmore of the following financial activities is required to disclose additional and\nspecific information about its Category 15 emissions or those emissions\nassociated with its investments which is also known as ‘financed emissions’:\n(a) asset management (see paragraph B61);\n(b) commercial banking (see paragraph B62); and\n(c) insurance (see paragraph B63).\nB60 An entity shall apply the requirements for disclosing greenhouse gas\nemissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a) when disclosing information\nabout its financed emissions.\nAsset management\nB61 An entity that participates in asset management activities shall disclose:\n(a) its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope\n2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\n(b) for each of the disaggregated items in paragraph B61(a), the total\namount of assets under management (AUM) that is included in the\nfinanced emissions disclosure, expressed in the presentation currency\nof the entity’s financial statements.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s total AUM included in the financed\nemissions calculation.

If\nthe entity calculates and discloses financed emissions for other\nasset classes, it shall include an explanation of why the\ninclusion of those additional asset classes provides relevant\ninformation to users of general purpose financial reports.\n(b) its gross exposure to each industry by asset class, expressed in the\npresentation currency of the entity’s financial statements. For:\n(i) funded amounts—gross exposure shall be calculated as the\nfunded carrying amounts (before subtracting the loss\nallowance, when applicable), whether prepared in accordance\nwith IFRS Accounting Standards or other GAAP.\n(ii) undrawn loan commitments—the entity shall disclose the full\namount of the commitment separately from the drawn portion\nof loan commitments.\n(c) the percentage of the entity’s gross exposure included in the financed\nemissions calculation.

In disclosing these\nclimate-related targets, the entity is required to disclose information about the\ncharacteristics of these targets as described in paragraph 33(a)–(h). If the\nclimate-related target is quantitative, an entity is required to describe whether\nthe target is an absolute target or an intensity target. An absolute target is\ndefined as a total amount of a measure or a change in the total amount of a\nmeasure, whereas an intensity target is defined as a ratio of a measure, or a\nchange in the ratio of a measure, to a business metric.\nB67 In identifying and disclosing the metric used to set a climate-related target\nand measure progress, an entity shall consider the cross-industry metrics and\nindustry-based metrics. If the metric has been developed by the entity to\nmeasure progress towards a target, the entity shall disclose information about\nthat metric in accordance with paragraph 50 of IFRS S1.\nGreenhouse gas emissions targets\nGross and net greenhouse gas emissions targets\nB68 If an entity has a greenhouse gas emissions target, the entity is required to\nspecify whether the target is a gross greenhouse gas emissions target or a net\ngreenhouse gas emissions target. Gross greenhouse gas emissions targets\nreflect the total changes in greenhouse gas emissions planned within the\nentity’s value chain. Net greenhouse gas emissions targets are the entity’s\ntargeted gross greenhouse gas emissions minus any planned offsetting efforts\n(for example, the entity’s planned use of carbon credits to offset its\ngreenhouse gas emissions).\nB69 Paragraph 36(c) specifies that if an entity has a net greenhouse gas emissions\ntarget it is required to also disclose a gross greenhouse gas emissions target.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if the entity discloses a net greenhouse gas\nemissions target, this target cannot obscure information about its gross\ngreenhouse gas emissions targets.\nCarbon credits\nB70 Paragraph 36(e) requires an entity to describe its planned use of carbon credits\n—which are transferable or tradeable instruments—to offset emissions to\nachieve any net greenhouse gas emissions targets the entity has set, or any it\nis required to meet by law or regulation. Any information about the planned\nuse of carbon credits shall clearly demonstrate the extent to which these\ncarbon credits are relied on to achieve the net greenhouse gas emissions\ntargets.\n© IFRS Foundation 41\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nB71 In accordance with paragraph 36(e), an entity is required to disclose only its\nplanned use of carbon credits. However, as part of this disclosure, the entity\nmight also include information about carbon credits it has already purchased\nthat the entity is planning to use to meet its net greenhouse gas emissions\ntarget, if the information enables users of general purpose financial reports to\nunderstand the entity’s greenhouse gas emissions target.\n42 © IFRS Foundation\n\nIFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS\nAppendix C\nEffective date and transition\nThis appendix is an integral part of IFRS S2 and has the same authority as the other parts of the\nStandard.\nEffective date\nC1 An entity shall apply this Standard for annual reporting periods beginning on\nor after 1 January 2024. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies\nthis Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information at the same\ntime.\nC2 For the purposes of applying paragraphs C3–C5, the date of initial application\nis the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity first applies\nthis Standard.\nTransition\nC3 An entity is not required to provide the disclosures specified in this Standard\nfor any period before the date of initial application. Accordingly, an entity is\nnot required to disclose comparative information in the first annual reporting\nperiod in which it applies this Standard.\nC4 In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard,\nthe entity is permitted to use one or both of these reliefs:\n(a) if, in the annual reporting period immediately preceding the date of\ninitial application of this Standard, the entity used a method for\nmeasuring its greenhouse gas emissions other than the Greenhouse\nGas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004),\nthe entity is permitted to continue using that other method; and\n(b) an entity is not required to disclose its Scope 3 greenhouse gas\nemissions (see paragraph 29(a)) which includes, if the entity\nparticipates in asset management, commercial banking or insurance\nactivities, the additional information about its financed emissions (see\nparagraph 29(a)(vi)(2) and paragraphs B58–B63).\nC5 If an entity uses the relief in paragraph C4(a) or paragraph C4(b), the entity is\npermitted to continue to use that relief for the purposes of presenting that\ninformation as comparative information in subsequent reporting periods.\n© IFRS Foundation 43\n\nIFRS S2 CLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES—JUNE 2023\nApproval by the ISSB of IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures\nissued in June 2023\nIFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures was approved for issue by all 14 members of the\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board.\nEmmanuel Faber Chair\nJingdong Hua Vice-Chair\nSuzanne Lloyd Vice-Chair\nRichard Barker\nJenny Bofinger-Schuster\nVerity Chegar\nJeffrey Hales\nMichael Jantzi\nHiroshi Komori\nBing Leng\nNdidi Nnoli-Edozien\nTae-Young Paik\nVeronika Pountcheva\nElizabeth Seeger\n44 © IFRS Foundation\n\nColumbus Building\n7 Westferry Circus\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 4HD, UK\nTel +44 (0) 20 7246 6410\nEmail sustainability_licensing@ifrs.org\nifrs.org\n© IFRS Foundation 45\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards®, IFRS Foundation®,\nIFRS®, IAS®, IFRIC®, SIC®, IASB®, ISSBTM, IFRS for SMEs®",
